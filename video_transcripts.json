it's just like oh you hate this baby I hate that too yeah I wonder how many guys are actually like dudes are like that like they're like do you like Trump see ya no not at all none not at all like it on social media but girls do it too A lot of those girls [EXPLICIT] there was a [EXPLICIT] thing like on my Tinder profile I put I have no religious or political views I put it on there and then I would like swipe and get a match and then it'd be like how can you not have any political views yeah that's gotta go to work it does sometimes you're like what the [EXPLICIT] are you talking about and like when I would registered to vote I registered as no affiliation and I got [EXPLICIT] for that too yup what the [EXPLICIT] from the people at the polls I'm [EXPLICIT] not kidding you I [EXPLICIT] pushed it over I was just like what are you talking about they're like oh no affiliation okay I'm like oh okay look [EXPLICIT] off yeah dude did you tell them you were in the industry I had some waiters and waitresses coming at me about your thing about not paying them I tipped them well I tip them well I'll tell you why I took them because I just started part of me [Laughter] that's gonna say order um Oh Shannon come on oh that was can you yeah you can do that I remember that I remember the cool kids would do that in my neighborhood yeah it's like it's not working one single black hat on the palm of his hand and light it off damn yeah you do the bottle I don't know where that was that's Billy's yeah do the bottle rockets out your hand yeah bad kids yeah they're so bad kids so yeah I want it the reason I tip so much is because when I started at Helium I had zero money yeah so like I'd be working a weekend and they'd give you free beers and I would just not tip them sure because first off I was hosting yeah I'd be getting 100 200 bucks maybe the whole weekend yeah and then it got around and some of the waiters and waitresses at Helium like hated me and were like mean about it you're poor I was a poor man yeah now I come in they're like we love you [EXPLICIT] scum you scum that's what I'm saying yeah and now whenever I'm out I tip excessively I always say well I'm 20 but you do not well if I don't know I'm a joke I know I was like I tip I [EXPLICIT] myself by going bro I would tip even when I didn't have a lot of money I would tip over high and like I remember that's industry code like over High whatever what's over High over the high yeah like all day in the kitchen yeah we got a four armless two sausages all day so anyway I would do that and that's over high like over 20 I see oh I'm always over yeah yeah you got to stay over it but it but I would do it but half of it was because I didn't know math very well so I would just like trying to be like yeah I've missed out a couple times I don't know what I'm doing so I would always tip high and be like wow it's very generous I'm like now it's double it like there'll be times like oh wow I'm like oh [EXPLICIT] yeah damn it I did not yeah I tip well but in my head I'm like I think we should do it we should I think it does a disservice when you uh pay a job that high that's that menial benefits I didn't get [EXPLICIT] benefits forever then they complained they're like you jump so hard it's like no it's [EXPLICIT] not it's mine Mr Pink I think it's hard a busy waitress it's I could literally never do but for 600 bucks I had to stand like to film things all day and I was like I'm just joking it's not even just obviously getting used to it that's taxing I'm saying yeah but you don't cry about it I see waiters all the time like so hard this guy [EXPLICIT] everyone's a dick everyone starts out with an F when they come in that's how I feel everyone there was a there was a community Bro Look do your job I don't care get paid but like I don't hear your waiters to shut up and dribble yeah that's what I'm saying shut up and drink I should do demolition I would like be doing that and be dealing with comedians who were like oh some guy was such an [EXPLICIT] at my table I only made 550 I think I made like 150 bucks out in the sun all day yeah you're gonna cry I think it's more like the way it is you know exactly what let's hear from the industries what I'm gonna say is that you know exactly what the [EXPLICIT] you're doing and you're in your element when you are dealing with the general [EXPLICIT] populace of these [EXPLICIT] animals that come in the goddamn building it's way different and here's something you've never had to deal with when you're doing this yeah you're a busboy but what I'm also gonna say is when you're there for [EXPLICIT] 13 hours you're dealing with another element with people pissing and [EXPLICIT] and puking and bleeding all over the [EXPLICIT] place that's the difference man a lot of people don't [EXPLICIT] get that because when you're at the goddamn job site you know what you're doing you don't have to [EXPLICIT] deal with other [EXPLICIT] retards you I'm [EXPLICIT] telling you dude everybody everybody [EXPLICIT] says it and don't get me wrong I'm not saying there are [EXPLICIT] in the industry it's filled in Strife with those [EXPLICIT] but the problem is sits on the industry because like I'm pissing it is a hard job it is a hard job it is if you've never done anything else that's harder okay I'm not look if you've never had any other jobs all right all right I'm also speaking from fact that I was a bar back I wasn't a surf so was I so was I so what I'm not you're gonna say on that 13 hour shift when you're moving a bunch of crap and you're also cleaning your birthday to me someone's diarrhea and someone's puke yeah that's see you'd quit yeah you don't have it because you can you know because I was just selling drugs I could do whatever I wanted I guess I can't [EXPLICIT] compete with that I think it is hard with the fact that you could lose your job at any minute because someone would be like I don't like your attitude use every job no that's not no that's your boss I'm talking about the [EXPLICIT] Yelp review bro don't do that I just love gassing up waiters any other job it's like your jobs are hard they're like all right dude whatever like yo waiters triggered you into this bad City I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry you're dating a waitress oh dude you're defending you know The Waiting industry it's servants you might get some [EXPLICIT] out of this dude I bet you do it's fine some highways and chick is just letting her billion her [EXPLICIT] jeans like yeah yeah that's the woman not you that actually sounds more like you yeah I support you in this argument I think Matt's being rude no he's but he's but he's not being he's not making invalid points just because you think about jobs easy yeah you can actually sell a lot of drugs in a restaurant oh there's tons a lot of drug addicts everywhere you're telling me yeah you'd cross us typically drug addiction the hardest workers what's that there's always drug addicts the restaurants are infested with drug addicts oh yeah he's complaining drug addicts easy job it's not that hard and they're getting paid and they're buying drugs yep trust me yeah they need to start working hard Like Comics yeah yeah dude yeah [EXPLICIT] I just filled up my backyard today dude that's hard work I was on 95 degrees just loving it dude yeah loving it I don't want to hear any lip I mowed the lawn the other day I don't want to hear it [EXPLICIT] bartender bartends cake dude I was a bus busboy bartender wait I heard you yeah how long did you do it for always a couple months and I'd be like [EXPLICIT] this I liked washing dishes don't get me wrong like if I was working in it like I'd never I never yeah I never wanted to be a bartender at all because I didn't want I didn't give a [EXPLICIT] about making drinks for anybody yeah that's I respect bartenders also a lot of times people never gave me a [EXPLICIT] no everyone's just mean everyone thought it was [EXPLICIT] that's [EXPLICIT] up I run into that all day yeah I respect because I would just stand me on the board a good bar keep they earn their money sleeveless Madness [EXPLICIT] dude the bar keep is the biggest do this I stole a bartender's tips when I was a boss boy one time oh man and it's funny because you're like these people don't work I'm just gonna go in and do the worst job let's go ahead and sell some boxing like [EXPLICIT] I'm out of here wow once I once I got enough money to buy like a half pound of weed I bet I quit yeah when the industry gets disrespected how do I feel it I'm glad you brought it because when I've I've been on the I've disrespected the industry myself I've run into some [EXPLICIT] ass there's too many antifas in what I'm gonna tell you like I said they suck there is a lot of shitty people who work in it they're they're not gonna get away from that and you're gonna get away and you're they're just jerks sometimes they're annoying people yeah they shouldn't be in there anyway yes but the fact of the matter is they're not the Richmond bartender that guy's actually they're chilling there are people who are just trying to work and get as much money as they can because they have other [EXPLICIT] going on but when people come in and they're immediately like oh this guy's working in a bars of course he's [EXPLICIT] stupid no no no but you said that you didn't say that you said yeah tantamount of what you're [Music] stop complaining it's just a job and they're very well paid what I'm saying is I'm not one for complaining about the job it sucks and you [EXPLICIT] that's why he complains all the time about the job oh all his Facebook posts and [EXPLICIT] you were coming at him [Music] girls do it girls are waitresses [Laughter] Westchester University Ryan's Pub you're big I let every single person in I didn't ID once that's great that's I never stopped one person that's your [EXPLICIT] thing but you're a big dude that if you said like hey do this they would [EXPLICIT] do it one thing that here's here's a [EXPLICIT] no everybody just pushes you to the side effects no drunk person is ever taking any anything there is nothing more humbling than trying to get in a fight with somebody and they just put their hand on you oh dude you your dick goes yeah you're a tough guy Wolverine I'll eat punches to get to where I need to be and you're usually blacked out yeah I typically had a hell of a chin on you while you're out there oh yeah I've been punched in the face many times because that's my reality you have to do that to get Matt's about to get you if you can't never do a little chirping at them oh dude I love it I love it dude I was working my Fields all day I have my land out behind me I have 40 square feet at 40 square feet of dirt I Disturbed my soil I was pulling worms out I discovered a concrete pad Candy Land over here you gotta aerate the soil my soil was like are you wearing a white suit [EXPLICIT] this dude whoa dude I've never this might be the most heated episode we've ever had you [EXPLICIT] that's coming in just it is my fault it is my fault what is your fault dude don't say no you're fine yeah don't say sorry it's because I'm Double Down Double Down give it away I won't no it's dude it's it's I actually feel like I don't think we're gonna say anything I feel like [EXPLICIT] I'm not telling them they'll tell us no way they remember the restaurant in Philly that paid like um it's a good thing they gave benefits yeah to the wages see that's what happened a lot of corporate restaurants do that they're yeah and now because everything is so been so devastated awesome me spot pain in the ceiling nice sick I was actually excited for them to do that and then it unfortunately went out of business and the waitresses are back to the streets just for tips only fans the only fans dude all the antifa waitresses are only fans also love thigh tattoos they love being little I mean I I like that it's not going to be cool you've admired some five or six years they're like foolish like buffoons they give birth I don't know about them cries like yeah I'm scared she's a tattoos yeah I'm all about it I'm all about it always have man love it love it you ever seen on a baby what's the best uh this one chick had and it like it was a it was a bunch of snakes that went up her legs up to her [EXPLICIT] which were [EXPLICIT] awesome that was tight a bunch of snakes like there was like three or four and then there was another chick that I was really into had snakes on her ass I had a big snake thing for a little bit which was nice on the ass snakes on the acid these [EXPLICIT] snakes all these [EXPLICIT] asses dude how many [EXPLICIT] stamps did you say you've glazed dude I [EXPLICIT] came on a Starry Night [EXPLICIT] stamp the entire report and I [EXPLICIT] gist on that that was a [EXPLICIT] station it was a huge what a [EXPLICIT] [EXPLICIT] was she in the industry nope nope she will be no no no no she will not [EXPLICIT] I've worked in it dude I was in the industry you barely barely ever in there or did you work longer destruction or the industry sure yeah the job I was building things dude how much were you building I was building were you building a lot I was taking them down how much how wiring ceilings how much what I do is important I build things so wait what the people do in the industry isn't important is that what you're saying is that what you're surviving no it's survival microwaves can do what they do your replacement TGI Fridays be like oh excuse me lady I don't want to hear your complaints do you remember that place California Sam's I know I have nothing do you remember that place yeah what was that man I have nothing against I really don't I don't think California Sams this was years ago they had phones at each other booths you just call in yeah it was like a big deal at the time now I think of it it's like they're trying to wipe wait staff way before you got to fire if you're running a restaurant I'm gonna give you from the inside scoop from a restaurant tourist perspective you gotta you're supposed to fire your entire weight staff every like you got to do a purge because they all start [EXPLICIT] stealing and [EXPLICIT] unionizing you have to you have to program every six months I don't know you gotta Wipe Out the pros I don't know I'm telling you they'll start they'll start giving stuff away one of the bartenders said yo come on in that's one thieves all first off they're giving stuff away giving stuff away is how you build a clientele that's how you build a clientele and you get regulars that are good you don't understand how this game works man you're out of your elements off and this is okay the sleeves are all the sleeves from a restaurant tours perspective who do you think's a bigger restaurant tour damn I was next to the rest of the restaurant tour and I'd be like I would cheat one of you what have you done I can't I can't I would see things from the background I can't respond I can't have no comebacks to the Taco Shop I've never I've never I know you want me to give you a couple ones what I'm saying is I've I've helped open it's like I sailed a ship the Titanic it was a hell of a sailing I didn't wait you [EXPLICIT] it up don't worry about it no he didn't no one [EXPLICIT] it up yeah man wow yeah jeez dude that was [EXPLICIT] up all right sorry no it was just it was the economy dude yeah the economy no it was the the staff was just got too expensive and he had to close it down no he sold it he sold it to the dudes that worked for him well that's yeah I mean yeah it still thrives it's wow good it's still alive but it's not dead what I'm trying to say is when you get the macro picture you see you see the bicker in you see the fight and you just go you know what it's clean house cut them loose you get a new Squad yeah you're capitalist you get a new crime Tycoon yeah that's wildly they get toxic they start getting like they start getting binds and fighting I'm telling once they get home so The Binding in the fight the fighting is terrible that's you're always going to deal with that no matter who the [EXPLICIT] oh dude especially when you own it dude you're hiring slots that love Coke and and dudes that love to prey on them exactly everything everything you're saying doesn't really apply to me because I don't do any drugs and I never show up late true that so I never all the things that you all these elements you're talking about you've never showed up like never I'm always on time or early enough sober I don't know let's put it this way let's put it this way there's not one job I've ever done in this world where I haven't had a few in the chamber oh my God that's the most that's like that is it's funny though because that's the drunkest dude thing like I'm always all the time I'm never late always on time I'm never late and I do my job accordingly if I [EXPLICIT] up I [EXPLICIT] up and I own it but dude one second I'm not gonna come to that job with a little sauce on the [EXPLICIT] brain you're goddamn dumb I hear you yeah that's [EXPLICIT] impossible you goddamn what do you think about this it's hilarious oh no I already know who you [EXPLICIT] supports you don't like waiters and waitresses no no no no people saying like my job is entirely too hard it's like wow is it I don't think it's that hard but I do agree with Shana with certain parts I am with her Tito because I worked in it I worked in the industry but then you know totally yeah I just I'm really my biggest issue with this whole thing I like that people calling it the industry I could [EXPLICIT] hate that again I despise people gone at the industry to save restaurants or bars I I don't know I don't know why the industry I think of like humongous yeah you think of the industry I don't know how that got adopted there are two things in the second in in the bar industry that I never knew why they got adopted one calling at the industry and two wife or net is so [EXPLICIT] popular it sucks it's dumb is what it is what is it it's like the the shift shot that everyone does every now and again it's like [EXPLICIT] uh it's a nice industry the industry is nice this is camaraderie yeah I like the industry I like certain people in certain places some guys don't like it no I'm saying it's fine there's no competitor than everybody either I don't think I'm better than them you don't think you're better than waiters and waitresses no man I don't know about that I think we all have unlimited humans yeah I said don't complain we all have unlimited potential dude I don't snuff any of them from doing their thing it's just that you know making 600 bucks a night you're [EXPLICIT] around you're not always going to last 600 bucksiano always no no he was in Philadelphia he was also at a five stars talking about make 400 oh I made I only made five bucks you got a bit of the jealous bug yeah he's not jealous I would hear I would hear the money and go that sounds like decent money up Lou is going a mile a minute like a [EXPLICIT] meteorite going into some chick's ass he was [EXPLICIT] lose yeah yeah guys I'm not mad I've heard a lot of complaining coming from restaurant people and I hear though I like how much you make I go it's not bad bucks there brother I mean you got it again you got to take into consideration how much is your job that you that the job you perceive and how much other [EXPLICIT] you gotta deal with and you you got to take your mind the match I'm sure a humble Blue Collar guy so if you're at the Hawking to him about this type of big box he doesn't want to hear any belly and here's the other thing too how much the restaurants pay their staff an hour how much do they pay him an hour right yep what's waste of like 325 yeah when I first well now it's it's up now because of the pandemic they're trying to get people to come back yeah no one's all the waiters oh yeah so that's that's the thing and it was also because the clientele got exponentially worse everyone's a [EXPLICIT] [EXPLICIT] now everyone's okay the people who come to the [EXPLICIT] bars they're terrible they're [EXPLICIT] terrible people what do they do they're just what complaining you want to talk about complaining everyone [EXPLICIT] complains shut the [EXPLICIT] up the waiters and waitresses and the customers like cats and dogs yeah oh yeah dude it's it's a it's bad it's great I ran into it I didn't even I ran into that buzz saw in Richmond dude I had no idea I was fighting with that I just told him I was on Molly 15 times and like they got annoyed the guy was a very good sport about it yeah he just wasn't on Molly too he just didn't care that's why I think that's what I was heard about yeah I don't know didn't care and I was like that's wrong with him that's wrong you should care if somebody comes up to me is like yo if I'm boring [EXPLICIT] on Xbox I'm like what you doing brother let's talk about it yeah you were the shaman dad oh man no you think that yeah I'd be a daytime yeah and then you'd be pissed off when because you can't give me a rag Matt you can't control the people who come in that's all yeah no white t-shirts no flat brim hats at all oh [EXPLICIT] yeah you you can't control the like the [EXPLICIT] that come in for a bronzer you can't control the people who come in for like that are just terrible and you'd think you'd be cool with it and you would be for like maybe industry I've been in the industry dude he's been in the industry when someone when someone would go [EXPLICIT] yeah dude I go high in the industry [Laughter] hello I don't want to talk about this anymore we're at 42 minutes okay the timing's off okay if you're part of the industry you would have been he knew exactly how long this shift has been yep I'm ready to clock out yeah I'm just [EXPLICIT] around I don't know I don't think I don't think you really hit it I do if you had to guess who do you think's more mad or apologetic right now yeah you think he's mad and apologetic uh yeah a little bit I think he regrets I'm more apologize you I owe him an apology I think you I don't think you owe me anything and I do regret it how I you better go over it no I feel bad about it dude hey he attacked you indirectly attacked your people it was an indirect assault on you because I forgot while he was talking I forgot how many times you've complained on Facebook about people coming in so I had no I didn't even think about it until I didn't think about that at all I know he didn't think about it but it was can we agree guys go ahead moderate this thing for a second yeah why don't you go Shake on it damn you guys are both strong damn who's stronger who do you think I don't know no no definitely never I would never say I'm stronger than anybody no I honestly almost passed out my backyard today

like a jet plane where the Air Force was working on uh ejecting people yeah and the planes are going too fast so it was tough to figure out how to get the thing to work so they were like testing it out on Bears yeah they're just flying the [EXPLICIT] up and hitting a jack on Bears they're giving parachutes yeah most of them survived a couple died a couple of boys oh yeah but then there was what was funny about it was in the paragraph on the Instagram post it was like they were taking guys out of uh like dudes that were unemployed were like signing up for it oh yeah and they're like testing test test the ejections I heard in the beginning and like uh I guess it was in Russia it wasn't in America but in Russia when they were testing they were like using like borderline invalids to go up in the rocket so like hey look at these monkeys we're gonna use people because we can't design it for like the people going up the Rockets aren't going to be the size of chimps true yeah we got to use people so they were just like hey you want to make some extra Rubes yeah and they would just get but they should be like all right denim also there was also a couple that they would tell apparently and again I don't know it's like an urban legend because they're still orbiting the planet like the retards from Russia dude they would tell them like look you're gonna go up there you probably will

[EXPLICIT] is up not much man I had to I had to peel myself away from video games to be here I've been playing tons of armor Corps lately no way when we were in Tampa I I punished Matt with speed running videos just the history of Castlevania huge speedrunning no oh my God it's when someone plays a video game as fast as they can so you know if you beat a video game you're a normal person you're like [EXPLICIT] yeah dude I beat a video game yeah imagine beating a video game like I could do that faster okay me and my friends used to compete in that like like when remember Zelda yeah Ocarina of Time when that game came out me and my friends was like yo who's gonna beat this [EXPLICIT] first bro cool now imagine that and I lied and said I beat it first I didn't I got to the final boss first he spliced but then I lost it bro I did I really spiced it so how did you was it over then did you have you been have you been carrying this live the whole time I had no nobody knows this until just now I've never admitted I'm sorry swizzy sorry Michael Barnum sorry I'm saying I'm bad yo I lied about that a lot I mean wait till the speed run damage forums hear about this I didn't know you could lie about Zelda I thought it was physically impossible I mean it's like a Deep Lie that's a children's it's like an enchanted like fairy forest and bro I made it to the end of the game before all of them did I just didn't beat the final boss so doing my first student with swizzy beat the final boss I really was like jealous but I was like [Laughter] yeah that's pretty much how I did it last week yeah yeah I told him I lied and said that there were two different ways to beat him but it's not it's not there's only one way to beat this boss at the end of the bro you told him you did the other way you're like yeah you did that but like yeah I distracted them on this side and then we just kept hitting him from behind he was like oh damn I didn't even think about that it doesn't even work on his back you can't do that well Naim that doesn't even seem possible the way I did it uh maybe you'd like to show us your controller and you're like um seventh grade or some [EXPLICIT] I'd have been done he would throw the whole class I think the N64 is overheating dude we should probably turn it off [Music] yeah Mom I will be right back you guys yeah I'm sorry guys I gotta leave yeah video game lying is uh a very specific form of lying it is so so nice it's one of the first Temptations for most dorks true the video you know what I felt it yeah I know I was curious if you've ever been tempted to video game live oh for sure I still I mean I'd still deal with it you know until I get both feet out of video gaming and I'm still kind of like in the trenches all the time there's just Temptations to be like oh yeah I killed the boss in the first try technically you almost did though I almost you almost I almost did take down the armor core six yeah I said your thing really crashed or is that a video game live video that's your is your thing really I have to present myself as a virtuous and honest man and there is video proof of this happening okay nice there's a video proof of the black screen occurring this the the audio continues I mean I have nothing to defend myself did you have to go did you have to go did you guys saw that right you guys saw it oh absolutely and then I had people saying that like because I I ran it back on them and I I [EXPLICIT] around with them I destroyed this dude on the on more than my first and a half attempt I'm not calling the second attempt that's fair and I had people saying that like that doesn't count you're one asterisk you beat him on the first asterisk yeah true as an asteroid it's an asterisk doesn't mean it's not the first attempt it was you got taken off I guess but yeah but here's the thing is like I have to live with this is your permanent record I know like throughout the entire Dark Souls series how you do against like the first boss again everyone wants to claim you're so awesome the first time that's all I have dude I have nothing else you're so honest and this is so I can't I can't I can't obviously I could delete the save and go back but as a person I can't go back true and have yeah you know what happened again yeah you know what happened I do but it's like that was that was it there's it's it was for everyone to see it's my heart's open and it's like you know I I guess I can't really say I'm a first I was thinking about how all of our ancestors are gonna see everything we've ever done and they're gonna have to be like yeah my granddad beat our ancestors are our predecessors I always call them ancestors yeah yeah we're the ancestors yeah cave drawings or babies babies they're gonna be like yo he beat it in one tries are my cave drawings and they're gonna go ah look at this dude [EXPLICIT] crash computer crash ancestors like a black word feel sorry about them

like stop it yeah no I want you I can go back ones you're not even a generation one parent I'm so lucky my dad is dead bro he [EXPLICIT] hated white people did he really what yeah bro he killed the white man he killed the white 12 year old boy when he was like no the he was 12 when the kid was 14. he killed a 14 year old huh he shot him okay with a 22 long rifle damn people don't know 22s can kill you oh hell yeah losing like 19. my dad was born in 1936 it was like 1946 wait what the [EXPLICIT] your dad was born in 1936. yeah he died are you missing an ancestor he was born in 1936 he was bit by a vampire in 1961. yeah wait almost here he died at 86. so you're not lucky [EXPLICIT] it's just like it's insane that he lived that long it is insane he lived it and he didn't quit smoking until he was 77. so wait he killed a white guy in 1947 and Thompson Georgia and then then my grandmom sent him to your penalty nothing because my grandma put him on the train sent in a year they was going to Lynch him they're gonna kill us about to say yeah I'm surprised he I was like I must get him Community Services yeah you know how he did it you know he got damn George sorces [Laughter] soft on crime 1940 South dude they burnt my grandma house down oh no just looking for my dad yeah that's one way to do it hell yeah where is he where is he not in here oh he's not here we'll never have nowhere to come back to well then he burned the house down here yo it's kind of like Skinner's boxing it's like was he here is he here is he not you don't know you don't know he could have been in there he could have not been you don't know where he is Trail but no he was on his way to New York when he did that I do like that period of time you could do something terrible and just go to another state everyone change your name you good bro he's gone he's gone forever oh yeah my dad's actual name is John but when he moved to New York everybody his name was Joe criminal genius damn so what uh what was the what was the fight about uh well he used to work at a supermarket and he said these white kids pushed this old back in the day you would take a Foot Locker with you to the supermarket and you put all your groceries in there entire store Supermarket you're looking to milk a tiny referee you guys like let me know if I can help you it's like The Indian in the Cupboard besides milk that you need wait so what so what is a Foot Locker it's like a chest it's like a chest with like a lot bring a chest to the grocery store people would bring like a treasure treasure chest I mean not that heavy like an Ocarina of Time treasure chest yeah similar very similar and these kids and my dad was working there and he was like help people put their groceries inside of the FootLocker and they close it put in the back of the horse and buggy or whatever the [EXPLICIT] they had back then and then they pull the [EXPLICIT] off signed up car yeah do you think he was blasting like jazz out of that thing oh he was dumping that [EXPLICIT] bro really and then so he was he was filling the Foot Locker oh and then they pushed the Miss out they pushed him inside the Foot Locker yeah and then they locked they closed and locked it but this one this one Foot Locker like I guess didn't belong to anybody so he just left it there and then they didn't find him to the next day so he got out he's the Ultimate Warrior of your dad yes they locked him in some [EXPLICIT] he was stuck there for like a day bro what hell yeah dog and then he freaked up I bet he knew these kids played so he went up he said he like went up in the tree with his 22 Long Nose rifle oh his dad's only too long on those rifle he saw him playing and he said he let off one shot and hit the kid in the neck I mean essentially that's like buried it's like the fear of buried alive yeah hell yeah so he was buried alive basically yeah one of the people that worked at this store opened it like oh [EXPLICIT] the [EXPLICIT] is this when they opened it was he like it was like there was a running track in there and there were tons of speakers there was a bunch of helpful gentlemen drift like officiators dressed like a fishy haters yeah bro damn that's [EXPLICIT] wild so he who let him out he went way too far but you don't kill you deal with it you got a lot if someone locked you in a Foot Locker for a day I I would say deal with it you can't kill somebody for that that's nuts bro dude but you remember to put your mind in the put yourself in the mind of a 12 year old spazzing true yeah that's true all right 12 year old spaz definitely in 1932 because back then it was just like and you get away Daddy's gun now yeah didn't you fight six cops for way less all right come on oh my God damn it Jesus Christ dude let me pretend to be a good guy Jesus Christ I did wait for what I beat up six cops before at the same time yes well they didn't oh yeah yeah you're a boxer they just wait like video games like this [EXPLICIT] anyway for you to hit them first yeah true I guess they come in one at a time one at a time do a little bit of kung fu yep take one out did you do any of those like you like Get Low and sweep your leg backwards on them take five of them down at once hit them all ninja turtle moves bro I'm still fascinated by that whole situation who let him out of the locker some uh I think he said it was his manager that worked at like the supermarket yeah and he said the manager was a white guy he said the guy let him out and he was like all right time to get to work and he like [EXPLICIT] this job and ran home oh my god did he have to like piss in the locker or anything he pissed and [EXPLICIT] all on himself oh yeah I mean this is you're building a case yeah dude it's so magic but imagine how when you have to like examine like first second third degree murder if you were locked in a tiny box and [EXPLICIT] on yourself yeah and then finally thank God some guy let you out I was like back to your shitty job it's like it might be gun time oh yeah I mean obviously it's not you you shouldn't shoot if that's the first thing you hear is your boss like all right you're looking back to work oh yeah might freak out yeah that might be Thomas net it's understandable you can't shoot people Bro [EXPLICIT] the kid or something you shouldn't but also as well it was 1940. yeah you get away with things in 19 1940s yeah there was you know I guess he said one of his neighbors killed another neighbor because he like stole some of his tools and the guy never got locked up yeah yeah that's a 1940s crime but not even as a 1940s just disagreement bro it happens like every day now if you do construction somebody steals your tools and you're like I'll go to Home Depot you don't kill them yeah but back then it was like you had your little tin pail it was like your great grandfather's oh yeah someone stole it your whole business class I had a way of accessing bolts and loosening them now I'm out of business [Laughter] damn that would sucked for for one thing just to tank your business yeah dude damn bro I could loosen that yeah otherwise you see that um painkiller [EXPLICIT] on Netflix no what is that you didn't see that oh Oxycontin is it like a dramaticized version of them it is nice but the fact of the matter is a bunch of people died from that [EXPLICIT] and these [EXPLICIT] is billionaires still I loved it you lived it yeah man I watched my mom go from Doctor to doctor getting new OxyContin scripts yeah dude I went through it that stuff makes me angry yeah yeah I don't really like it very much you're gonna take it this is nuts I remember I remember it was almost when when the painkiller stuff was like it would approached like a tsunami people were just like yo they're they're putting out you know they're talking about before I ever even heard of anyone getting a prescription they were already talking about how you just Chomp it and break the uh release yeah yeah what yeah I knew about people abusing Oxycontin before like it even hit the streets yeah that's crazy you think well you know I don't know any like Street Walkers who are just [EXPLICIT] panhandling and abusing drugs and then it was like one doctor gives you the prescription there's no like support in place it's like the mid 90s and I just dude I watched it tank this lady they have to use that Ground Zero with that oh absolutely yeah I watched doctors be like nah and then it was like well I'll just get a new doctor and then you go to a new doctor and they're just like yo you're in pain here you go babe like you know they hit they hit us with a fibromyalgia which is like yeah I don't know I don't know how real that is well it shows up it doesn't show up I don't think on really anything it does yeah that's the thing and then it's like you argue because it's like oh I'm I'm Ill and it's like No One Believes Me and then it's also like I read years later that like it's it's basically a syndrome that comes up after you've like really gone deep on painkillers and then when you're off them everything just hurts I thought it was when like girls are in a bad mood for too long if it's got fibromyalgia must be that time and when moms get addicted to smoking cigarettes in their room that's fibromyalgia yeah damn and then uh Comcast introduced uh Turner Classic Movies and it was just oh [EXPLICIT] yeah I think if it becomes not fair enough you get fibromyalgia one set must be nice [Laughter] she used to like throw herself on the ground in like the driveway of emergency rooms like she would throw herself in front of the ambulances so that they would put her on her bed and take her oh God damn yeah he's gonna hit you with the morph um get something while you're waiting for it yeah I don't even like being sleepy so much I don't get it where the [EXPLICIT] is the point of being sleepy all I hate being sleepy I hate just getting sleepy naturally I believe why my body doing this to me it's a woman women love sleeping they do you're right they love the net I think sleeping is painful same I hate it it's a waste of time I am you know my sleep routine is right now what my super teen is uh I stay awake for as long as I physically can and then I fall asleep going like that's it like when I fall asleep once dead yeah you're dying and then I wake up and I go [EXPLICIT] that sucks I just like I slam things around to make coffee in the kitchen yeah on three and a half hours of sleep I go never again man she's sleeping with just the

your keys right now oh [EXPLICIT] over here wait a second who cares I don't give a [EXPLICIT] no problem I was it's so weird how much of that problem I was because alcohol I'm like why are you so [EXPLICIT] mean to me and she didn't even really care that much bro she was being a [EXPLICIT] but [Laughter] oh man I was part of so much of that by being like oh god oh [EXPLICIT] oh you're looking yourself up because you know what you think it's a confrontation coming and then you walk in like oh is this confrontation let me say something it's subconscious like childhood stuff it's like spaz Mom it's remnants of spasm oh so that's why I'm like that yeah if you have a spaz Mom it's like as soon as your wife gets upset you're like I think she's going it's bad so I'm like preparing myself you're ready for a humongous lady could you imagine if she doesn't listen to the cast does she Brittany yeah I told her yeah no but I'm just like because I can't imagine a worse weapon in a woman's Arsenal then you know I'm not your mother right oh yeah that wouldn't work on me because dude oh I mean I can spin that real hard doesn't matter damage is done dude you're doing it with like a seriously like a Terminator hole in your head and sparks flying out she's dingy at that point yeah true but I mean I could I could just be I could easily just be like my mom rules love my mommy I get I get I love my mommy it just doesn't feel strong to me no yeah true I shouldn't give her any ammunition but no it was nice dude we actually like navigated a situation that would have ended in like just a negative start to the day yeah and it's so funny you're adults but you do have that part of yourself that is like completely spun out over simple stuff she's like well I found the spare backup key so it's not a problem I'm like I'm glad you found that key I'm going to continue on my day I'm totally fine as well your text didn't spin me out either just both on edge dude it's amazing how much of that stuff just like you don't even realize it filters through maybe it's just me I don't know no no you're right about that but it's in my girl yeah you know my my girlfriend likes to she yells over minor things sometimes and if I'm like talking loud in any in any place anywhere anytime she shushes me bro and I hate that [EXPLICIT] dude don't do that [EXPLICIT] bro don't shush me I hate that [EXPLICIT] why you gotta talk so loud all the time because I do dude I get the same thing I hate that [EXPLICIT] why you can't whisper like I shouldn't do it like two days ago you know you're not whispering right I'm not trying to [EXPLICIT] shut up the [EXPLICIT] I hate that [EXPLICIT] dude getting shushed I hate it bro it's getting sure spins me yeah I can't stand because then you start being really loud you're like I'll be fine I'm talking at a normal volume yeah it feels like normal volume but I did realize my family we all talk loud and it made me realize that one time I was out with my ancestral thing super duper loud but I only realized when I hear my siblings talking I'm like why the [EXPLICIT] are you yelling like that and I'm like yo this is me that's the same thing I do yeah that's another thing women can do they'll get in and like do the print out of your whole family and be like you know what's [EXPLICIT] up about your family you're like what are you talking about oh my God yeah all of us are really normal and fine that can derail you for like five years yeah when they tell you how your family's [EXPLICIT] up because then you're like wait maybe she's right you should say like maybe but she is right and then you start trying to like recreate yourself but you can't you're like damn I grew up around these people yeah but then you can turn it around and be like [EXPLICIT] your family your family's [EXPLICIT] up too you want to pray yeah and give the my family my brother Tom was telling me about this recently my I have a huge family like especially on my dad's side just like literally I think it's like 70 people including all the causes novels yeah but everyone gets along for the most part my brother thinks it's actually his is a spin-off if I have a cousin who was the first one to discover our whole family was autistic because we had one cousin moved away and was like holy [EXPLICIT] my whole family extended family is like very very you know it's popular to say now but I think everyone's just touched a little bit Yeah my brother was like the reason everyone gets along so well is there's there's not like a straw I mean there is an emotional connection but it's not like expressed whatsoever not really felt either but it's just nothing but data dumps it's just our family gatherings are just dudes waiting to talk and then you see someone yeah have you been to Dorney Park yo I've never been there before everyone just dated dumps on each other okay bye it's the sickest thing in the world oh hell your rules and just dropping random facts I've never heard one of my cousins say anything like why are you doing this why are you being weird it's just just data dumps yo you're kind of a [EXPLICIT] and everyone laughs and that's it that should be every conversation that's the best it's so tight you're so blessed it has anything to do with like the size of your family just because there's so many of you guys true you know that could be it too there's no room for anything to be intimate there's just so many people everyone's just trying to claim a cell in the spreadsheet what else is going on with you guys you know what I mean no

a store where I'm not buying anything I go hey baby how's it going I have a decent eye for women's fashion I've learned because I've been trying to embrace it when I go there and it's actually really easy to pick out clothes with them just like put that on and this on oh my God I would never thought of this I said well holy [EXPLICIT] I never thought of this either dude I'm telling you right it's actually pretty fun are you going on levels then you can access I've had to just I just started embracing I'm like I'm not gonna be a curmudgeon dude I started accessorizing I'm going this is great but like you need a little necklace dude you need a little something else so you have a full stylist yeah I'm gonna try that that might make it fun yeah because otherwise I've been trying to not not get into things if I'm gonna do a thing I'm gonna get into it rather than like when I was a teenager at the mall with like a high school girlfriend I would just be sitting there like oh say oh I'm complain like yo why does it take you so long to just pick something when I go to the mall I know exactly what I'm getting why does it take you so long to just get what the [EXPLICIT] you want what's happening right now I've been trying to get into it yeah actually it's pretty funny I was like I had a good time at one time last time we went I was just like this is so fun damn that's I use that time to go through all my group messages that I never talked anybody in and respond to all this [EXPLICIT] oh like that's what I use the time at the mall for I go through every comedian group message I'm in yeah every Christmas I got with my homies and I'm just responding say yo we said this two weeks ago I know bro but I got free time now let me answer these questions let me respond that's fair dude what do you uh what do you know as a black comedian group message y'all ain't know that really let me I just gave up secret look at the mirror yeah but really nice what are you doing right now before the record I did know about it I'm sorry I should have said that it's okay dude I went too far it's like an Open Secret I guess yeah there's a Philadelphia black comedians group message how many people were talking what you think Lemire Maybe 20 20. because I know there's been beef some beef exactly yeah probably like 20. maybe 20 30. two Ray in this group chat [EXPLICIT] no he don't [EXPLICIT] with us then it's not it's not the official it's not a fish they don't [EXPLICIT] with us like that but it's not certified sorry true yeah you do got to get two rating for it to be official no that's pretty tight what do you guys talk about uh we baby we [EXPLICIT] on we basically just [EXPLICIT] on people nice for the most part maybe lady Comics get it the worst in the in this group message really yeah lady cops get it pretty bad weird I feel like we kind of took all the Flack for that a while ago you guys are still partying there weird dude and then the black and then whatever black uh Comics that weren't invited to this group message get it pretty bad too oh okay so all y'all out there if you see in this black Philly Community you're not in it we talking [EXPLICIT] about you bro damn that sucks it's [EXPLICIT] up I'll start a group message with you guys Jason [Laughter] hey yo y'all should make a white comedians uh group message that's a hate crime that'd be a [EXPLICIT] hate crime yo they had that [EXPLICIT] uh Philly Comedy Network Facebook thing that was just oh yeah let me remember that [EXPLICIT] now you run that Lemire yeah how did you grab control of that thing uh during the pandemic uh I was bored so I was like I want to run for admin like I tried to do a presidential campaign to be who was the admin of it it was uh Nicole Yates and Alyssa trieskowski and they were being lame so I was like vote for me as admin of the Philadelphia Comedy Network what were they doing what were they doing that was uh bugging you they just weren't posting anything what was irresponsible back then to go out and do comedy you're killing people yeah they would delete certain posts too like if you put like a podcast clip Up they'd be like no this group was just for shoes you like I can't put the podcast clip in this [EXPLICIT] all right yeah good move the [EXPLICIT] over now is beautiful I had to I had to create another one because they're like they like blocked me out the group and I was like uh like if you want to do it so bad make another one I was like all right I'll make the exact same thing but wasn't it founded on like a democratic kind of vote for the admin or did you just go through like a little kill yeah I was trying to be funny democracy and he took everybody with him everybody with him damn he [EXPLICIT] them over that's pretty tight yeah I like it I like it I like to go in there and troll I like to go in there and be anonymous and be like I'm an open Miker well I'm only getting five minutes on stage how can I build an hour for my HBO special I'm only getting five minutes on stage I say I'm like maybe I should put like the new people ahead of like the old people have been doing comedy like [EXPLICIT] these old guys and then people are so amazing hey dude kill yourself who the [EXPLICIT] are they were going crazy in there bro that [EXPLICIT] was fun did you have a fake name or you went on no you can put up messages anonymously but let me know who it is like because so they knew it was me but nobody else knew it was me oh that was so much fun that is pretty funny I like people getting angry at me when it's not really me when it's really me I get depressed have you been have you been the subject of a Facebook beef um kinda kinda but I'm if I'm beefing with somebody I know I'm right because I'm quick to apologize I'm quick to say when I'm wrong so if I'm beefing with somebody it's easy for me to be like you a [EXPLICIT] and a hoe and you dead wrong you know what I'm saying yeah yeah I wouldn't beef with you under any other circumstance Trail so yeah I've had some some Facebook beasts I started the Pod a couple times I don't I don't go on Facebook anymore but I remember I uh I somehow it was pretty nice I somehow got the alt white [EXPLICIT] versus the black Comics oh [EXPLICIT] I had a thing that had like is that all white guys were being [EXPLICIT] about I think uh that warm daddy show they had like some comedian came by and they were like making fun of it I forget who it was it was like some black comedian who was on like a show it was like a funny it was just like a funny name you see they started [EXPLICIT] on it I'm like man that's [EXPLICIT] up all the white nerds are attacking the black Comics dude it was just like 500 comments stage name yes oh no it wasn't even that there was the person they booked they were like that's so stupid like who cares about this guy because it was like the guy I genuinely forget the name it was an actual like name it was like a famous person it would be I guess if you had like Urkel come before it was like something like that like a famous dude it was something like that people come with Urban Stefan I was Easter I'll go see uh what was what was his name when he was Bruce Lee I'll go see him on stage who what he work with Dr Bruce Lee no the black guy made that type of machine to be nerd cool guy karate guy nerd cool guy karate here Michael Jackson molester yeah with half a face true that's after you master karate yo you know what I didn't believe that he was he was a molester and I saw this interview and the guy was bringing up all his surgeries and he was like they said you had a dimple added to your chin they said you got your lips why they said you had dimples added to your cheeks you had your nose shaved down and the whole time he was like no no they don't give me credit for anything no I'm like oh he's just a bold-faced liar yeah bro you obviously got your nose shaved now you always got a dimple attitude the guys and he was like no oh my God no wait so your whole position is that if you lie about surgery you [EXPLICIT] kids bro but you thought that the kids were lying and you were Charmed by his response originally yes did he make comment about the allegations or I think that's why he just started having that guy put him to sleep yeah he said it was like a money grad oh that's what you're saying and some of them were money grabs which is why I believe them because some of the kids did just straight up lie Macaulay Culkin used to chill with him he he said Michael Jackson never touched them true he didn't tell the crazy guy what's the other word Corey Feldman said Michael Jackson never touched them true why did he [EXPLICIT] them bro true exactly you'd [EXPLICIT] call like okay Home Alone get past all this traps put your dick in his mouth the face you did in the mirror when he was in the bathroom and then you just slide your dick in there that is the ultimate though not for guys John Lester hidden face [EXPLICIT] Home Alone cover yeah that's a fair point now I'm glad you brought that this is the job Lester version of like uh Pua guys who are just like girls you don't have guy friends you just have guy friends who haven't [EXPLICIT] you yet it's like kids child actors listen you don't have child molest your friends there you go true damn booby trap is roller coaster so you can escape the theme park yeah Corey Feldman said no yeah McCauley said so why would he [EXPLICIT] these other kids come on yeah true maybe he's just politicking though those are those are Heavy Hitters to have on your side saying he didn't do it you know yeah he [EXPLICIT] like backup dancers for Shakira or something like that who are you gonna believe Home Alone Oh or you know this this guy with a dangly earring in his right ear that's true there's more trustworthy but here's the thing he [EXPLICIT] [EXPLICIT] the kid into being a backup dancer Felicia care he created a career for this kid bruh this was a kid when he [EXPLICIT] him he was a kid you're saying that kid would have made an accountant yes if he didn't he would have been an accountant a cashier some stupid [EXPLICIT] now here go Michael Jackson gave you the magic dick now you can dance you know what I'm saying do you think I was gonna say do you think it was like a uh you can dance or do you think in some of those sleepovers he was kind of hitting him with some cool moves okay you're right it's that that is what it is yeah he gave him the shine that's all he cared about was dead do you guys remember Emmanuel Lewis yeah yeah Michael Jackson used to hang out with him he was like Webster or something yeah he said on his lap yeah he was a he was a grown ass man at that time Webster wait what he was like Gary Coleman yeah but he's a permanent child and he was hanging out with Michael Jackson a lot and there's a video there's a video of him sitting on myself basically yeah yeah God damn dude yeah there's a video I'm sitting on Michael Jackson's lap and it looks kind of like oh it's just a kid hit on his lap but then they're like yo he was like 27 in this video totally legal it was just legally that's what you don't want to hear about it well you guys know in anime right you know how it's like uh oh [EXPLICIT] lemur you're gonna have to help me out on this but you know in in hentai it's illegal to animate child pornography yeah so the way that they get around it is they've created a ton of characters that are a thousand years old but stuck in the body of a child like [EXPLICIT] Krillin bro so he was just doing hentai with Webster yeah that's crazy so technically ah this character is over a thousand years old and damn bro I love a good loophole I tell you that way they say exactly yeah do they say exactly what how old of a body they're stuck in they just say child I mean I think you're just like scrolling through thumbnails until you find what you like I see what you're saying there you go this is all perfectly it all depends on the The Stroke of the artist yeah and that might have gone by the wayside as well that was that was the long thing are you did you follow any of that stuff they broke kids from the curse I I think Japanese high court was like the curse yeah the curse what's the what's the legality on this why are you sweating so much right now all this stuff the the anime thing where like the perverts had to stop animating like children in sexual situations like demons like succubuses yeah is that still legal yeah I think so I still I see new succubuses [Laughter] is that where the tentacle comes from they're like this isn't a child they have an octopus tentacle no that's something different that's just from their heavy Seafood diet true yeah they do eat a lot of seafood they eat a lot of octopus too exactly because they think so in America we get [EXPLICIT] by cattle to death and in Japan octopi Slither into your uterus damn and it's like you know that's good not for me but I know I yeah for sure I mean you know octopus can change the texture of their skin yeah dude they can just turn into just a little like I think they can get ribbed on you oh they can just turn like almost like a leopard that's pretty tight yes like it's not like chameleon piece of [EXPLICIT] no you're gonna change your colors bruh uh octopus can actually change the texture of their skin they can make their skin like the texture of what they're looking like that's nuts that's pretty wild damn alien [EXPLICIT] bro I got to show uh Maya lizard changing his color oh yeah he's pretty pumped on that I just told her about it it was a green lizard then it went away and I was like you know I think he turned it brown in any second right she was just like what yeah so we can hide and she was just like as soon as you saw the first person we saw a lizard turning brown she's so excited oh yeah so [EXPLICIT] pumped hell yeah show pumps yeah bro she was pumped to be equipped yeah no kids are smarter too yeah they're way smarter than us that's because people talk to them true yeah damn that's crazy you're right dude my parents were just like be quiet all the time be nice be quiet they were never like yo you see this B right here guess what this thing does right it's just like dang are you right be quiet I actually had to train myself to answer questions from the kids really because Fritz is six and he's all questions and yeah if I'm in the middle of doing something and he's like asking how it works first it's can I help and you go you can hang out with me while I do it yeah you're useless and then he'll say why are you doing that and then my instinct from my upbringing is to be like because that's how it works and instead I have to be like well you know how we plug things into the wall well there's actually electric like dude you gotta explain the whole thing step by step which is which is great and enjoyable I'm just no it is though it's fun that's not what I was wired to do I know it's so funny you start turning like you're like you tune into that just like just that's just how it works Dad how's that work go away yeah I want to get this done so your mom doesn't bother me I want to get this done before the [EXPLICIT] game starts yeah what are you writing a book get out of here I only go there when they repeat the question like if I answer you once and I got my two-year-old does this a lot where she's like Dad what's that and I'm like first of all who's that that's Sean Gardini baby chill out you know what I'm saying like don't say what's that to a person and then she'll say it again Dad what's that and I'm like I just told you who that was and I told you how to ask that question now I'm not answering you because you said it twice so that's it but I explained to her why I'm not going to answer her again yeah well apparently so I was reading this thing and they're saying that kids have like genuinely no concept of like anyone else's reality until they're seven seven years old I think like if you show a kid there's a there's a seven it was six or seven they said there's a bull so if you give a book the front screen the art or the back's orange you hold the front you go what color is the front they go green what color is this and they go orange and you flip the book back around here what color am I looking at they go green they can't yeah because they say they can't do perspective taking until they're about six or seven years old that makes sense well I would even think older because I in all honesty bro I ain't know that I felt like I was the only person that was real so I was like 19. everybody just loaded up bro I don't know why it was real I'm the only real person so for six or seven is kind of early honestly because I was like 19 20 years old what's the realization like I had I had cheated on some girl when I was in college and she was so like [EXPLICIT] up and distraught to the point where like her sister and her mom called me like yo she's really [EXPLICIT] up but you really [EXPLICIT] her up and I was like she had like a whole like family and story behind her like she's a person like she like the same way I got a story behind me she got this too I was like wait everybody got this [EXPLICIT] that's so wild damn I had the complete opposite experience where I was so aware of other people that it was almost like torture for me really really yeah oh yeah I had the exact thing Naim had I would just be like no thought yeah whatsoever I was I was stopped in my tracks regularly like with worry for other people and like that I can tell because you still kind of like that now bro you still got some of that [EXPLICIT] with you what do you mean like you're very aware of other people and like their feelings yeah you're very aware of everything I always feel like a huge piece of [EXPLICIT] I'll be like yeah [EXPLICIT] it he's like well yeah but I feel it's kind of [EXPLICIT] up I'm like yeah I guess it is essentially sad for that person to completely brush that off like you're good at presenting other people's arguments like if I'm like yo I got a problem with this guy because this is a net you're you're very good at being like how many people now you think about it like from his point of view if he's like and he's like all right you're right I'm an absolute agony over my this perspective searching dude all the time dude when I was like a pretty young kid I was probably like 10 or 11 years old and uh I I had I had brothers from um different moms or no these ones had different dads so y'all got this nice match dude none of us matched up okay yeah so I had I had a brother who almost was like that's impossible it was a part of my brain it was like got him that's not possible okay Paul is a different mom my wigger Brothers have a different Dad okay okay that's what it is yeah and so uh my brother my brother Paul was into like hardcore and [EXPLICIT] growing up and like you know he would take me to shows as a young kid and they were [EXPLICIT] pretty crazy but there was a point where my my two different wings of Brothers tried to co-mingle for a little bit and it was it was oil and water how'd they get along of course I mean they kind of tolerated each other as long as they needed the same thing from my parents right right like a ride somewhere like that but uh when they were like almost adults they went to a show and one of my wigger Brothers it was a it was a you know they're going to see like punk bands and [EXPLICIT] and my wigger brother uh tried to like grind on a dude's girlfriend oh hell yeah that's nice yo I that's so tight how much of a wigger is he like bro I did I the biggest the number one phrase that I remember him from him growing up is I remember him answering an early cell phone and being invited somewhere and he was like we'll see we'll see they gonna have honey dips there oh yeah so he had it I'm not leaving the house he had a honey dips policy basically I'm not showing up unless there's honey dibs that's an ultra wigger bro like fully scar-faced out as an adult obviously dude so tight that's so tight the honey dips I wish I had the confidence to say [EXPLICIT] like that yeah he drove a big uh Buick with like a red felt interior and just like smoked weed in the car on his lunch breaks and stuff he had a Buick yeah that's also what black people think that's a nice Buick bro that's pretty tired yeah he's [EXPLICIT] on him he had a Riviera yeah and I think a river came with 19-inch rims on it if I'm not mistaken he stayed on the uh he just reminded me yeah dude every now and again there's certain cars that white people are like whatever about that black people sweat so [EXPLICIT] hard yeah dude I used to have I couldn't remember the card he's like that's the little car dude I had a Mercury uh it was like a Mercury Sable or one of those cars Hollywood top dude had the rag top yeah and I used to when I when I was selling pills I'd always be in West Philly and these do I would come out of this bar and these dudes would have a class let me buy it off let me buy it off bro bro how much bro how much I think dude I'm not selling my car it's my only car I can't sell this to you yeah like that's your first car and then your next car is an infinity [Laughter] he tried grinding on a dude's girlfriend and he got rolled on and they [EXPLICIT] him up these were dudes that were like already spin kicking each other and they beat the [EXPLICIT] out of him and he came home and uh he had to be like wrestled down by like my dad and like two dudes because he tried to leave the house with like a kitchen knife he was gonna go back to the venue with like a eight inch kitchen knife and he had to like wrestled down and I saw him dude he was [EXPLICIT] up dude beat his ass and I was so upset for him I this dude this dude hated my guts every day of my life and we never got along and I was just I remember as a kid like losing sleep just like damn dude that probably sucked all those guys beat the [EXPLICIT] out of you yeah bro imagine we got in there with the butcher knife though oh there's a bunch of dudes like maybe one or two of them then somebody would they'd have beat his ass again and took his knife and stabbed him put him on their shoulders and another guy with a stage died and broke his neck what
