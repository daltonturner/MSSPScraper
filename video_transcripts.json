the pro balls damn damn happy happy Eid y'all we need to eat more than ever dude yeah for real especially at the end of Pride dude yeah we got it Gotta Eat rebalance rebalance I feel like I woke up this morning at three o'clock and had heterosexual sex with my wife nice and uh [Laughter] and I had a weird realization this morning that I feel like pride in like 200 years is going to become like a Mardi Gras or Mummers Day Parade Where like nobody knows how it started why are we doing this everyone is flapping their dicks why are we doing this again like our kids kids will be like I don't know we always have fried parade is totally gay members are coming it's just less Clues it is I'm telling you people are going to forget or they'll be like I heard like they used to not want guys to blow each other and they're gonna go huh yeah that's crazy what are you supposed to do when you're with your boys yeah we play UFC 23 and then we blew each other yeah and then I was like dude [EXPLICIT] oh dude it could be loser sucks the squad within our lifetimes yeah it's getting there it's close we're like it's close I'm sure there's some basketball team players with like some stories like some losers cookie stories yeah it's totally losers stories I hope the Beer Olympics doesn't lose their socks you drink 40 beers and just throw up on someone's dick you're like you're getting sucked by the boys though you'll truly be busted well dude you could be you could be could be demisexual dude you know what demisexual is no I was uh we went out to dinner with friends recently and the uh someone one of our friends like works I think with the younger people uh she was saying that demisexuals like first of all she was like nobody straight she was like yeah you're Antiquity yeah if you're like a young kid and you're straight people are kind of like all right dude like it's like being a 1950s conservative now they're like yeah cool man that's kind of weird so weird but she was saying a lot of the people are uh it's like federalism Demi's the new thing demisexual is the new move where it's like you only It's A Step Above asexual it's not great it's asexual gray sexual gray sexuals when you're mostly like asexual but every now and again you'll get a little Rumble in your penis or something just go like ah and you just let it pass that's gray sexual and you don't whack you don't you don't dabble don't even it doesn't even I was great sexual when I lived with Nate I was great there's no way you are well you were whacking in the shower you told me it was the thing I still think about when I said weird guitar fields and land before time and go in the shower you're stuck somebody I'm just yelling opening the window I think Sarah the Triceratops I've been stuck in a bottle yo that whole Squad was the [EXPLICIT] Sarah Littlefoot dude the names why don't they remake they should remake Land Before Time that's why they like let that they let that go that would be up there with them doing the new Transformer Beast Wars mix for me they bring back Land Before Time and B scores my childhood is like I'm realistic it's so nice you're too gay Tyrannosaurus [Laughter] 3D Land Before Time that would be sick like if Disney makes me look real like a live action dinosaurs what's wrong with the big lips I know yeah demisexuals when you so you're not Grace actual Demi's when you're not exactly like you're not dying to just like hook up with people yeah but if you become good enough friends with someone they could ignite the spark in you like a mental connect like a mental it's a mental but like you you can only get activated sexually if someone like proves they love you dude I'm a demi which you might be a demi you might be Demi but funny because it's all these like younger like lgbtq kids it's like they're describing like Conservative Christian love yeah just being conservative in love you're waiting for the connection in the right time yeah I'm waiting for a real connection they're trying not to like uh uh proselytize being a [EXPLICIT] you know yeah yeah that's what the good girls can get in on the fun yeah yeah I've been dating my boyfriend for 14 years probably gonna get married I'm [EXPLICIT] gay yeah I got pink hair I'm telling you man that's my prediction couple hundred years there's gonna be people out there like why do we do this again yeah I feel like you all had the answer to this but when did Demi is Demi a fairly new thing I think so it has to be right so I mean yeah since the 2012s like me yeah it's been around it's been around it's just probably hasn't been like it hasn't been co-opted by Street kids yeah some absolute [EXPLICIT] weirdo with a master's degree point this probably in 2012. I only like my friend I did a study of 34 individuals and came up with a new thing yeah it's insane yeah I love ruining friendships too yeah damn dude that must be so crazy though to notice the one time like you're BFF and you're just like I love you out to dinner with you yeah [EXPLICIT] the first time oh [EXPLICIT] the cross you're sick and they bring you soup and you're like [EXPLICIT] yeah my brother's like he's he's bi he's bi I'm sorry I still come to terms with it he's by buyer pan is he pan or buy which one's pain pan is like super bi we're like you're not even worried whether the people you're having sex with or men or women you're just like yeah my brother's paying he's paying he's truly paying they're I think they're king of lgbts even pants might be Secrets have you seen debris walking around in the city yeah I gotta show you this picture of him he wore a spike collar you know into a bar it's it's so crazy looking but at the same time it's kind of a badass that's what I'm saying dude [Laughter] he was saying like uh is you really truly the best hang when you could just like hang out with somebody play some games and you're like Wanna [EXPLICIT] and then like yeah and then you just go about your way he sells it well like if you could get hard yeah he does refuse to bottom which is the bottom dude yeah yeah it does provide so much pressure to bottom I'd suck dick not the bottom she's out here surviving dude all right all right here's a here's a wow hypothetical yeah wow hypothetical you you you're gonna suck dick or a bottom uh it's a pretty big dick but he also comes lows like Peter North what do you choosing but I I want my ass to get devastated by this baby well you want your face just the amount of [EXPLICIT] matter yes really I think so I think I honestly I don't know if it was a teeny dribble I'd be like what the [EXPLICIT] yeah okay I spit it right through my teeth I go yeah but no I'd be like yo for sure totally you can [EXPLICIT] me but I'd be super hit I'd be hands-free dude oh my God all month long or is it just like one or two is it like the same Patty's Day thing we're turned into like yes every weekend yeah drunk kids walking around like yeah yes Pride month's a long celebration can I go down there and masturbate I feel like I feel like it would take you could get away with it for a little bit though yeah yeah there's nothing to do with gay sex I just came down here to master that if you get someone to jerk you off you can say yeah true no I want you want to masturbate on the periphery like a saboteur dude an agent provocateur I'll ruin it for everybody click right Dead next to the parade I'm gonna go jerk off next to the White House I was trying this as a bit but like how come there's never like business gaze it's always like gay guys and like fairy you never see like a gay guy in a suit you know yes you do they're always in suits not at the parade okay you don't see any gay guys in suits at the parade they got stuff to do the parade is the one time they can cut loose it makes sense that they're like I'm gonna get this off my chest now I'm gonna spaz out yeah under the business suit is just like leather yeah yeah yeah yeah Superman yeah I feel like yeah I thought you're saying gay guys don't wear suits I was like I think a lot of those guys were suits but yeah business yeah I feel like business gay dudes probably still let their hair down on the weekends pretty hard yeah yeah I'm pretty sure they go like Ferry mode on the in the for the parade and stuff only though it's like a special occasion thing yeah you think they save all their gay up for the entire Year's worth every while just run through the parade naked yes there's so many children here what the kids saying that connection it's like to make that connection I don't know [Laughter] that would be funny for a flash mob of like 300 black teenagers to just [EXPLICIT] T-Bone the pride parade you think they'd bounce off of it I'm powerful we don't have enough what do you uh what do you guys think about banning the baklavas cript yeah what is that ski mask the sheisty oh they're banning them the Phillies can't wait to figure out how to ban it but they're also saying like well enforcing it's going to be racist yeah you got to go Scooby-Doo on all the black teams this whole time a couple of white guys from the Appalachia on these dirt bikes we finally got coached another black teen I can't believe it yeah it's going to be a funny one for them to try to regulate yeah because they kind of have to do how is it not how is it racist they're like you got a mask on take it off yeah well my thing is like you're dressing like a criminal yeah either you're using them to evade facial recognition which is like you know if that's what you're doing knock yourself out or you're pretending to evade facial recognition where it's like you can't pretend to be a criminal there's some facial recognition evasion software you could just like put several like dots on your face and then it'll like [EXPLICIT] it up really yeah just like like marker just not markers probably like little like dots with like yeah that was making me laugh I was reading it they're like well unfortunately this will be targeting black youth and it's like yeah definitely but also I see I see white dudes rocking them every now and again too yeah yeah like I never had a couple I mean you got to be busting down yeah yeah like K A and stuff yeah yeah yeah if you're a white dude wearing you are up to no good you're not trying to look like it exactly yeah I mean yeah I I say do you see any shakes these on your recent k a uh oh it's everywhere it was [EXPLICIT] everywhere yeah it was everywhere I I say we do a two for one where it's like you go hey you can't wear that or it's either you take off the shyster or you pull your pants up [Laughter] it was crazy how mainstream they got you can buy them with real money in like video game basketball you could be like one NBA 2K you could have a sheisty mask it costs like eight real dollars worth of video game money you can have a sheisty math score there's so many people with them though I know it's like every time I play it's mostly shiesty mask it's I mean look no nobody could have predicted through the pandemic there were a lot of unknowns but who would have thought we would have created a like trendy black fashion look that had to be dismantled that's tough dude that would be like trying to stop the Cupid Shuffle in real time hey hey don't go right you go to the right but don't go to the left he's kicking his feet he's kicking his feet yeah that's a it's a nightmare dude that's a tough thing those cops have to be like hey uh you can't yeah the shuffle was the fastest way to lose like Simon says you know because he never says he's Simon Says wait what in the Cupid Shuffle he never said Simon says he's just you do civil disobedience yeah it was I was still operating on Simon Says hands on the car does Simon say I know my rights dude can you can you uh commit perjury if your fingers crossed your honor check the tape dude in jail on the phone yeah somebody don't stop dude and I'm going to I'm gonna let it play I'm just gonna go to sleep to it every night yeah it's Gotta support Thug so Gunner did snitch yeah yeah did you guys listen to that R Kelly album with the weird one that got leaked the the uh yeah if I not if I did his if I did it yeah yeah or I admit it he's cleaning this quote I admit it he's claiming that he nothing he had nothing to do with it with the album yeah really he's claiming that someone must have ai that or something or he was just like I don't know damn dude the AI figure is that makes sense now that you're saying it but it is because the the lyrics want to work kind of like self-incriminating yeah didn't he have like like someone's like I'm a bad guy I shouldn't have done all those things and [EXPLICIT] like that there was a pre three-part song called I admit it yeah three-part songs kind of Isa that might have that might have been kills himself ai's not that good yet to do a three-part series no not yet dude I think it was him and then he was like if this doesn't get me out he thought I was gonna get him out like this guy seems sorry yeah it worked last time when he did the Chocolate Factory yeah he thought it'd be fire he's like this is fire yeah yeah there was some good songs there's like one or two I was like damn I wish I had that on Spotify it started strong and then it took I didn't get to finish it then they take it off after like two days or something like yeah I went to I listened to it like on YouTube oh still up there yeah yeah he yeah kind of like what what so he definitely he peed on the girl on video allegedly when you beat that case yeah he beat that case what was the thing he actually got in trouble for then he married Aaliyah apparently she was underage but he got a parent's permission yeah he did get the documentation so that yeah that's out what did he go to jail for what do you go to jail for yeah what was the exact charge yeah I think it was the child endangerment no no no uh would it be like it was something involving keeping people in his basement oh he was yeah he was getting into like dungeon play with you yeah yeah that's just a little kick you can't yeah I mean unless are you sure he got offered did Mr Big finally get him put in jail yeah oh no yeah what did he do he it was convicted in September on three counts of producing child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity was one of those the ogp video because I think he never actually got off on that I think they just stopped like sending him oh they got him yeah yeah yeah then they were like all right he's getting some steam bring it back yeah true I mean it was his [EXPLICIT] living room yeah he claimed AI in like 1997. yeah so he was he does seem like one of those guys who films every sexual encounter yeah yeah damn that means he has sex with kids three times three counts three counts then approving four is a series part one party it's a Trilogy the trilogy could have struck back yeah that's a shame he you know shame he had to go and be a pedophile yeah but he claims it didn't he claim that his mother or his aunt used to like make him eat her [EXPLICIT] or something yeah he has like a crazy origin story where he was like eating his aunt's [EXPLICIT] it's crazy that he was going by the Pied Piper the whole time and like this guy's great that was his thing it kind of was a bit of a Pied Piper yeah yeah just think a little tune the kids followed him yeah yeah what happens to those kids where they go with the Pied Piper dude they don't come back Brittany said that he he's from Chicago and Britney's from Chicago and yeah she said when she was younger like there would be an invite that would go out to be like you want to go to party at R Kelly's house when she was like in high school and [EXPLICIT] she said a lot of people she know would get the invite to go there even when she was in high school yeah the invite would just get spread around like we're going to a party we're going to work Kelly's house again could be you know money and power you could do anything you'll spread the word at the high school yeah there's a party [Laughter] you gotta see the covert operative into the school that's before any like Myspace I'm like you do like you're like yeah I'd love to come sing for the kids but let me get your email list I'm gonna have a function can you imagine sending your wife off to high school like come here honey have a good day I just said to think about the fiesta remix video it's just like a high school dance poor cows bro how long is he in jail for like 20 years The Best of Both Worlds part three part one was Jay-Z right yeah part one and two with Jay-Z yeah man Jay-Z join the Illuminati do you think Kelly was a sacrifice [Music] I feel like yeah because if he's filming videos he's giving them to somebody true yeah or did he have a stockpile of videos filmed and tracks recorded yeah a lot of these dudes have like nine million songs recorded yeah true you know there's something just like in the boot just like in the vaults I would if I were them I would just be using AI as well and just be like if I get any good songs from AI put that up yeah [EXPLICIT] sick did you ever hear like the Jade the AI Jay-Z song no uh I mean there's no way we can listen to that house but it sounds just like a Jay-Z song like the voice the lyrics like yeah they're all it's a Jay Z song what what percentage of your families would you say thinks Jay-Z's the Illuminati [Laughter] should black people believed in each other more because uh because of [EXPLICIT] like that like the second you do kind of well it's like Illuminati or like uh yeah what's his name Gucci Mane he got in good shape from being fat they were like cloned [Laughter] yeah there has to be advanced technology mostly wearing glasses too that's cool dude nobody knows about that the Clone conspiracy is the funniest [EXPLICIT] [EXPLICIT] yeah yeah dude goes on a diet so I cannot believe he [EXPLICIT] got cloned Kevin Hart I think is rumored to be a clone after the accident Joe Biden's a clone well he is

hibernating squirrels their brains shrink to like almost like an undeveloped when like Scrolls hibernate their brains like all their neurons and stuff just like you know like your brain's like a bunch of like neurons connected like millions of them it shrinks to like a real simple setup and when the spring comes their brain starts growing almost like like grass and trees like it'll just start like hitting new connections and almost like the rate of like a newborn child yeah and it happens more than once in their life yeah dude they [EXPLICIT] pass out and their brain just completely degenerates it gets they get so cold their whole body I think is like three degrees Celsius like it's freezing yeah I forget what it was something like that and then they just uh their brain just like with the spring their brain grows do they remember I don't think so no I think that's a thing like I could confidently say no I think I read somewhere that like that Soul or maybe I heard it somewhere but like that's part of why we have trees is because they hide all their [EXPLICIT] like they hide all their acorns then they hibernate and then they forget where they put all this their brains their brains completely almost disappear and their brain regrows and they wake up like [EXPLICIT] [Laughter] wake up just [EXPLICIT] hot as [EXPLICIT] like I'm [EXPLICIT] starving I just run around for a maniac dude you're chilling eventually just pass out and just go offline in Detroit they have like black squirrels like yeah we had black squirrels in Havertown I don't know and they would eat like they would eat like chicken balls and ripples dude they because they're culturally black because they forgot they forgot dude they're like this what's around me yeah they were so [EXPLICIT] fast look how the black squirrels are faster [Laughter] I remember saying it was like no irony be like yo those ones are fast as fast as hell same boat squirrel what do you guys been up to yeah dude panties yeah what's the point going how's it what how's the pornog going yeah you guys are deep on the pornography uh I'm trying to get out yeah I'm trying to break out yeah I'm coming man I learned it was like I went going I've been Whole Hog into the porn obviously and then I've gone like complete I'm never watching this ever yeah and then it was like it I was just as as obsessed with it when I was like I'm not watching it at all as soon as I was like yeah if like my wife has her period or whatever I'll just watch porn and Fab and just dude I just they lost all of its Allure to me but so you you would so you just a little bit here and there I didn't think I was a little bit here and there kind of guy Shane would be like yeah just use it when you use it I'm like you don't understand dude I think about it it's like alcohol I think about it right when I'm done I plan for the next one I leave a tab but yeah luckily it was just been like yeah not even it's not even a big thing it's weird I took that whole time off but I swear to God I was just as obsessed with it just like so I'd really like to watch that right now yeah now I just feel like I think I'm just getting older honestly I wouldn't yeah I get I went 45 days but it was like I think by like day three it's like I just want to look at some of it I'm not going to use it yeah you still pull like I pulled it I was like all right I'm not it doesn't count if I if it's just on the screen if I don't like it but it does it does count yeah you like you I look at it for like 20 minutes and it just felt tired like I whacked it like my well dude so the book I was really you got drank the same way like mentally though not like physics but like it like you just watched the end of your huh yeah so they were saying that in that book I'm reading they're saying that if you flood so if you're like you know most addictions are to things that flood you with dopamine like the positive like if you smoke meth it's a positive flood but that the pleasure Drive is just like innately connected with pain avoid displeasure so if you're if you're flooding your dopamine on porn there is by the law of nature there's going to be just kind of a small kind of flood after or like a a drop in those chemicals if that makes sense yeah so there'll be a period that comes are just kind of like yeah and the lady with the lady saying people need to start focusing on is going more towards the pain side because then if you go if you have a very painful experience or like a controlled painful experience then the pleasure chemicals come to kind of mitigate the pain if you're always chasing the pleasure you're just ramping up the pain is that where like the ice baths yeah that was a primary example where guys like stop doing coke because then they start just hitting ice baths so like rather than chasing the high and experiencing the lows they chase the lows kind of like controlled you don't want to like cut your dick off but it's like Chase those and then all of a sudden you just get like those nice feelings coming afterwards so like when you when people cut their arms they're actually doing self-healing pretty much yeah in a way that's why I do it yeah yeah cutter yeah they're on the rise Cutters are on the rise around big time really yeah Cutters in high schools is up like a lot a lot of kids for mental health or no I think they're just talking about upset and they're [EXPLICIT] we need some new CKY for these kids Trail or we need a new terrain loving our arms for these kids yeah wait what's the right level though some suicide [EXPLICIT] yeah to write love on your arms to write love on your to write love on our arms it's like I don't I don't know exactly I think it was some guy it's like weird emo stuff dude yeah it's mad emo because like some guy's girl killed themselves or something and he was like oh she could write love on her arms and then he like made a bunch of shirts and [EXPLICIT] I hope that's right about that yeah yeah they talked about in that same book they talk about a guy who tried to kill himself in like a field at Stanford and he like slit both his wrists and it just didn't work I almost sat there in a field bleeding like they kick you out of school oh yeah you can't kill yourself at school they're gonna get out they don't kick it they don't expel you but they say like you have to take time and then prove to us that you're stable enough to come back yeah so I think that took a bad thing for college it's a suicide rate of college is pretty I think it's pretty decent how many look at how many kids kill themselves every year in college uh good amount of kids go there and you go nope when I lived on Temple campus I lived I was across to like an alley from a suicide like I didn't know like a guy like I was just playing games and they're boom and I was like their shoes fireworks there's you know it was a gun they're shooting on the street and then I heard another one like boom the first one didn't take no because uh Pete told my roommate at the time he told me uh he told me oh that's what somebody recent yeah I'm thinking when you went but you didn't go to school until it was like 2021 were you still Grace actual at this point yeah yeah big gray dude big gray boy damn he just shot himself twice yeah because he missed the first time or he failed the first time yeah they missed that first time when I'm such a [EXPLICIT] idiot man can you imagine the like you're like [Music] [Laughter] dude stop what the hell are you doing yeah it's no good dude it's crazy what's this what's the stats on College suicide I'll be curious 24 000 attempts while only 1100 succeed in their attempt period 1100 succeed per year yeah making it the second yeah girls attempt more

are in suicide is on the rise I I think that's like a whole subgroup of people I saw somewhere online they just Exist by gamify in their life like they'll go online and be like write a book today three points knowledge like legit live there day to day like how I wanted to make a program like this for people in jail where it was like you have so you have a little Avatar you have your character it starts off just basic no points and if you do certain things like it's almost like if you're and it would all be like you know you'd have like some people and they do work there being like all right you actually read it they test you so if you read and you got it like the thing you gained out XP points for knowledge in the game yeah if you did physical activity they would mark it off in your character and then at night time everyone could play in this kind of like fighting game yeah and then your your character can only give and there'd be prizes obviously if you win the fighting game man you're talking GTA San Andreas yeah no like San Andreas and San Andreas you're playing CJ you can get jacked you can get fat that's what I'm saying but it would have you'd have to put in the metrics in real life yeah and your avatar would get those qualities and then you'd be able to cut you'd have to leg up yeah and if you won you could get like set reduced sentence time money center you know little little prizes the actual Rehabilitation that make jail so fun yeah other people getting locked up that games I gotta play this game they have to figure that technology yeah dude that's GTA San Andreas it's already happened like they just got but you can't fight that's the part yeah they have a one-on-one fighting game driving game you can get different skills if you got like if you look got your CDL you can take the truck and actually you drive a little bit better pretty sick flight simulator it's like yeah yeah you get the I was about to geek out on the new flight simulator I do want to play that everybody simulator got me I got into it for a little bit first thing I did was fly I played into the Freedom Tower did you really yeah it does bounces it won't explode already the buildings have no physics but my plane just hit and then fell hit the ground yeah land on everybody just right in the middle of the city yeah it killed millions of people killed a lot of people probably killed a lot of people way more than 9 11. dude apparently the um I took off from Newark so when they dropped the when they dropped the a bomb on Japan yeah obviously it killed 200 000 people immediately but they said there was a lot of other people who were on the periphery of the blast who got low dose radiation yeah and apparently the life expectancy of those people Rose incrementally compared to the normal population really so in a way it's a very it's a hotly contested study but they were saying basically like we just hooked up a bunch of people with like light [EXPLICIT] chemo well dude Japan's a country of uh uh gray sexuals dude so did we help them well already I thought they were like freaks no they don't [EXPLICIT] dude they don't [EXPLICIT] really yeah is that or is it like only like two guys it's two Japanese guys [EXPLICIT] the whole time yeah I think no I think Japan I think they're very sexual aren't they they only have all kinds of weird game shows they don't have sex their country is like their population is falling they have too many old people yeah everyone's in everyone has that in Stormville now besides like yeah pretty much it's like every country besides like Africa and India yeah and India is probably well on their way yeah if India becomes the number one country the world is doomed why do you say that because they suck this country sucks damn there's other countries yo every time I see a death or a line that's like it shouldn't have happened it's in India what happened what do they do I saw what it was uh it was like some stews they were like just going over something then the one dude just like leaned on the wall it fell through it fell through the wall and you can't see him his body hit but you see like car lights just little triangles and like so he was high as [EXPLICIT] and just fell through a wall man I seen a different one where it was like a sibling thing like a banister it was but it's every time you see some [EXPLICIT] up infrastructure [EXPLICIT] or like somebody dies in a simple way it's in India every time I didn't know that yeah there it's like if I went to Indy I just be careful yeah I'd be anywhere [Laughter] yourself [Laughter] [Laughter] the Indian cool I think it was like this the whole time he was falling I did he probably hit one of these people that his foot was up like this hands in his pockets elbows out he's probably cool as hell you know last week you guys if you're an Indian guy and you're falling seven stories you gotta give him [Laughter] I feel like if you live there you got a game plan a cool fall three-story death move right you just you just just have to expect it at this point he did that on purpose dude yeah he was trying to oh my God I think if India rose of power would be awesome India just dominated China between India and China rooting for India yeah China yeah I know they'll probably eliminate each other though I don't know dude if I mean China yeah I I have no idea I can't even I'm acting like I can talk about India's resources versus China's but off of like swag alone I'm saying I can talk about that yeah if we're going swag alone I Gotta Go China dude China is more swag swag out of all these I mean the animes are out of this brain dude photos what are you talking about well all right if it was a Chinese swag if we're going movies they do have similar swag they're they're sorry but I like the robes with the with the buttons and the ornamental you know [EXPLICIT] they both have derivative swag yes I mean I could see the parallels drawn between their swag but I don't know nothing the Indian nothing in Indian like mythological elephant thing yeah you're right though the dragon with a [EXPLICIT] murdered like the elephants the dragon's Just an Illusion um what even is that try this guy be like damn it all right India's Buddhism went from India to China really yeah yeah and that's like one of the main ones and I think they're what it was China Buddhists yeah confusions I don't know what that's all about we'll go Confucianism I meant to look this up 20 times I think if I think infusionism is like you love the government and you just try to be honest I forget I like that you love the government trying to be honest we got to be Confucius over here I think I I swear to God I think that's what it is because that was the big battle in China was between the Dallas and the confucianists they also have fireworks too yeah they didn't they didn't yeah they invited fireworks I think China invented paper currency as well they invented the bag dude the fact that they invented the bag that's major swag as well I wasn't convinced until just that yeah [EXPLICIT] dude they invented the [EXPLICIT] bag uh Confucianism a central tenant is having good moral character there you go yep but it says it's from ancient China it's a tradition philosophy religion uh also called ruism or Rue classism nice I don't know yeah I think they're just like be a good guy back then they also believed that if you were like and in any way disfigured that you were a bad person and that's kind of like what you got like this is this is your your do-over in life they're like yeah dude if you were like laying on the street like crippled they'd be like [EXPLICIT] walk by like [EXPLICIT] oh panties we were talking about uh Andy's cat yeah

almost like a sexual invalid yeah where like your penis is just like untouched in the limb for like just weeks at a time what have I done to myself it is the real scoop obviously it feels good to be like go quit it do all this stuff but I ran the experiment there is there's like a down time yeah I don't know man maybe it's best but I feel like if you're if you grow up in the you know the environment of pornography dude you you're just like all right I'm done with my your dick's just like all right cool because it shot a lifetime of loads yeah yeah by the time you're 30 it's like yeah

anarchy symbol on it yeah three different shades would be nice and ice cream bird I'd add RGB lights to mine it would look like a [EXPLICIT] PC how much look up how much it is to add one more inch I'd make it vibrate rotate my wife would be so mad rotating metal balls on the side on the bottom of the base on my new base tendon and they just pull more dick out of your body really yeah look I think

the boner like go to the bonus good question trust me I thought about this you have to re-up like is it but also your dick's getting hard inside your body as well so it's probably fine yeah it's true
