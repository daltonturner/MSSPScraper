to take the number seven train to the ballpark but there's some kid with AIDS fourth time right next to some 20 year old mom with four kids it's depressing and about New York City itself rocker said the biggest thing I don't like about New York foreigners I'm not a very big fan of foreigners you can walk an entire Block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English Asians and Koreans Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish people and everything up there the hell do they get in this country I think who's that picture for the Braves I think he was I think Colin Quinn on Weekend Update because they brought out they like did that joke or whatever really Colin goes well the guy's definitely been to Queens but then that was Will Ferrell's like one of his first breakout things really he showed up on a weekend update with the Braves Jersey on the hat he's like damn job I throw heat I throw heat I can't find it I've been looking for Will Ferrell as John Ross it's an interesting connection because that was because McBride and McKay did Foot Fist Way yeah and then it's basically he's Kenny Powers Yeah yeah anyway it was making me laugh of uh the biggest thing I don't like is foreigners dude I'm not a big fan of foreigners you can walk a block and not even hear English my favorite is the reporter voice saying crazy crazy [EXPLICIT] like that where he goes and he said quote these gross ass foreigners be smelling like cooked chicken hearts the main thing I don't like about New York is the foreigners I'm not a big fan of foreigners dude what's rocker up to

I've been trying to forget about 33 years ago yeah that has to be one of the toughest fan hoods of all time bills yeah that three stars I'll tell you what they're not liking your boy right now who I was on Santino's podcast and I told a story which was true about when we were walking through the parking lot of the Bills Dolphins playoff game and this lady came up to me and I did the accident they were mad because I was like doing an accent like I was Canadian they're like that's not how we talk will you talk like a [EXPLICIT] [EXPLICIT] so there you go but we were walking through the parking lot dude and uh it's a very bills friendly pop oh I know I'm making my case right here this lady was hammered by the way Bills fans were talking [EXPLICIT] but they were like nice yeah they weren't like Philly yeah it wasn't like we were legitimately worried for your safety yeah and they were like oh you guys want to see the crate this is the playoff game also they cut it off but it was Skylar Thompson but they were mad at us they're mad at me because I and this is a swear to God 100 real story we were walking through the parking lot this lady is tailgating and she goes are you guys going to leave if it's 35 to nothing at halftime and I went are you going to kill yourself if Skylar Thompson beats you in a playoff game and she just goes that's just being a Bills fan [Laughter] on my dead father's grave McDaniel's wife will testify that that is that happened while we were walking to the stadium we were right in front of the stadium and that lady did that she just went like hey we were like not even close she's like hey you really Dolphins fans and we're like yeah yeah and she was like you guys gonna leave if it's 35 to zero and I said that she's like Annabelle's fan I was like that was the nicest I broke character I'm actually a 49ers fan that might have been the Sweden I just saw the damage the 90s did to you right yeah they are they're like they need a Super Bowl just to get back to zero that's honestly it's a lot how I am at a Notre Dame tailgate really that Ohio State just talking yeah you guys we're gonna [EXPLICIT] you guys out there like we're gonna kill you I'm like I know you guys yeah [Music] I get that with like uh Chiefs fans when I talk [EXPLICIT] as a Niner fan I'm like oh [EXPLICIT] you guys and they're like Well why'd you let us come back when you're up 10 you're like yeah that was [EXPLICIT] dumb there's nothing like the Chiefs come back to ruin everything you were there we both experienced that last time I was on the podcast we were talking about that that was the first time I haven't re-watched that game since I watched the quarterbacks on Netflix oh yeah they did that I did the obviously the Super Bowl something I forgot about that you sent me recently on yeah my bad which I forget where I was I was I think I was in an airport and I looked at it and I went like this oh it was the 2000 uh 11 NFC Championship game with the Niners and the Giants and we were in overtime and the part returner dropped the punt and then the Giants kicked to field goal went to the Super Bowl we're like I was flying to San Francisco the next day I was like and it's brutal just a muffed punt God damn I can't wait for football season I know every year when football returns it's so fun special time no matter what's going on in my life the NFL is always there it's patriotic and patriotic it's weird man like hat just that clip I understand because it's what the internet is it gets taken out of context and people get mad because they don't know the proper thing because I was telling that story on stage at Helium and buffalo and they're laughing being like ah yeah also Buffalo is a team without cheering for McDaniel then I want to see what everybody wants Buffalo the Browns and the bills are the two franchises I want to see win a Super Bowl that haven't done it yet why because they dude their cities have just been kicked around yeah and if you've been to Cleveland and buffalo Cleveland you've never been to Buffalo no they need it Cleveland it's better than buffalo buffalo you go there and you go like God damn I see why you love the bills and why your wings are so tasty gotta come up with something delicious it is like Brazil to exist yeah but it is a great comedy Town those kind of towns where everything's been forsaken that Cereal Factory right next to the club yeah I always always smells like delicious cereal I can't smell how dare you bring up my disability you never experienced that no I always joke around I'm like
