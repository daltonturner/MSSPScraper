kidding that much Shane laughed and I went yeah that was a funny thing of me to say dude what the [EXPLICIT] is up not much man I had to I had to peel myself away from video games to be here I've been playing tons of armor Corps lately no way when we were in Tampa I I punished Matt with speed running videos just the history of Castlevania huge speedrunning no oh my God it's when someone plays a video game as fast as they can so you know if you beat a video game you're a normal person you're like [EXPLICIT] yeah dude I beat a video game yeah imagine beating a video game like I could do that faster okay me and my friends used to compete in that like like when remember Zelda yeah Ocarina of Time when that game came out me and my friends was like yo who's gonna beat this [EXPLICIT] first bro cool now imagine that and I lied and said I beat it first I didn't I got to the final boss first he spliced but then I lost it bro I did I really spiced it so how did you was it over then did you have you been have you been carrying this live the whole time I had no nobody knows this until just now I've never admitted I'm sorry swizzy sorry Michael Barnum sorry I'm saying I'm bad yo I lied about that a lot I mean wait till the speed run damage forums hear about this I didn't know you could lie about Zelda I thought it was physically impossible I mean it's like a Deep Lie that's a children's it's like an enchanted like fairy forest and bro I made it to the end of the game before all of them did I just didn't beat the final boss so doing my first student with swizzy beat the final boss I really was like jealous but I was like [Laughter] yeah that's pretty much how I did it last week yeah yeah I told him I lied and said that there were two different ways to beat him but it's not it's not there's only one way to beat this boss at the end of the bro you told him you did the other way you're like yeah you did that but like yeah I distracted them on this side and then we just kept hitting him from behind he was like oh damn I didn't even think about that it doesn't even work on his back you can't do that well Naim that doesn't even seem possible the way I did it uh maybe you'd like to show us your controller and you're like um seventh grade or some [EXPLICIT] I'd have been done he would throw the whole class I think the N64 is overheating dude we should probably turn it off [Music] yeah Mom I will be right back you guys yeah I'm sorry guys I gotta leave yeah video game lying is uh a very specific form of lying it is so so nice it's one of the first Temptations for most dorks true the video you know what I felt it yeah I know I was curious if you've ever been tempted to video game live oh for sure I still I mean I'd still deal with it you know until I get both feet out of video gaming and I'm still kind of like in the trenches all the time there's just Temptations to be like oh yeah I killed the boss in the first try technically you almost did though I almost you almost I almost did take down the armor core six yeah I said your thing really crashed or is that a video game live video that's your is your thing really I have to present myself as a virtuous and honest man and there is video proof of this happening okay nice there's a video proof of the black screen occurring this the the audio continues I mean I have nothing to defend myself did you have to go did you have to go did you guys saw that right you guys saw it oh absolutely and then I had people saying that like because I I ran it back on them and I I [EXPLICIT] around with them I destroyed this dude on the on more than my first and a half attempt I'm not calling the second attempt that's fair and I had people saying that like that doesn't count you're one asterisk you beat him on the first asterisk yeah true as an asteroid it's an asterisk doesn't mean it's not the first attempt it was you got taken off I guess but yeah but here's the thing is like I have to live with this is your permanent record I know like throughout the entire Dark Souls series how you do against like the first boss again everyone wants to claim you're so awesome the first time that's all I have dude I have nothing else you're so honest and this is so I can't I can't I can't obviously I could delete the save and go back but as a person I can't go back true and have yeah you know what happened again yeah you know what happened I do but it's like that was that was it there's it's it was for everyone to see it's my heart's open and it's like you know I I guess I can't really say I'm a first I was thinking about how all of our ancestors are gonna see everything we've ever done and they're gonna have to be like yeah my granddad beat our ancestors are our predecessors I always call them ancestors yeah yeah we're the ancestors yeah cave drawings or babies babies they're gonna be like yo he beat it in one tries are my cave drawings and they're gonna go ah look at this dude [EXPLICIT] crash computer crash ancestors like a black word feel sorry about them dude [Laughter] summon them to summon them please don't summon them please please don't you know how mad our ancestors would be heck dude yeah I need help in my relationship like your wife is what like stop it yeah no I want you I can go back ones you're not even a generation one parent I'm so lucky my dad is dead bro he [EXPLICIT] hated white people did he really what yeah bro he killed the white man he killed the white 12 year old boy when he was like no the he was 12 when the kid was 14. he killed a 14 year old huh he shot him okay with a 22 long rifle damn people don't know 22s can kill you oh hell yeah losing like 19. my dad was born in 1936 it was like 1946 wait what the [EXPLICIT] your dad was born in 1936. yeah he died are you missing an ancestor he was born in 1936 he was bit by a vampire in 1961. yeah wait almost here he died at 86. so you're not lucky [EXPLICIT] it's just like it's insane that he lived that long it is insane he lived it and he didn't quit smoking until he was 77. so wait he killed a white guy in 1947 and Thompson Georgia and then then my grandmom sent him to your penalty nothing because my grandma put him on the train sent in a year they was going to Lynch him they're gonna kill us about to say yeah I'm surprised he I was like I must get him Community Services yeah you know how he did it you know he got damn George sorces [Laughter] soft on crime 1940 South dude they burnt my grandma house down oh no just looking for my dad yeah that's one way to do it hell yeah where is he where is he not in here oh he's not here we'll never have nowhere to come back to well then he burned the house down here yo it's kind of like Skinner's boxing it's like was he here is he here is he not you don't know you don't know he could have been in there he could have not been you don't know where he is Trail but no he was on his way to New York when he did that I do like that period of time you could do something terrible and just go to another state everyone change your name you good bro he's gone he's gone forever oh yeah my dad's actual name is John but when he moved to New York everybody his name was Joe criminal genius damn so what uh what was the what was the fight about uh well he used to work at a supermarket and he said these white kids pushed this old back in the day you would take a Foot Locker with you to the supermarket and you put all your groceries in there entire store Supermarket you're looking to milk a tiny referee you guys like let me know if I can help you it's like The Indian in the Cupboard besides milk that you need wait so what so what is a Foot Locker it's like a chest it's like a chest with like a lot bring a chest to the grocery store people would bring like a treasure treasure chest I mean not that heavy like an Ocarina of Time treasure chest yeah similar very similar and these kids and my dad was working there and he was like help people put their groceries inside of the FootLocker and they close it put in the back of the horse and buggy or whatever the [EXPLICIT] they had back then and then they pull the [EXPLICIT] off signed up car yeah do you think he was blasting like jazz out of that thing oh he was dumping that [EXPLICIT] bro really and then so he was he was filling the Foot Locker oh and then they pushed the Miss out they pushed him inside the Foot Locker yeah and then they locked they closed and locked it but this one this one Foot Locker like I guess didn't belong to anybody so he just left it there and then they didn't find him to the next day so he got out he's the Ultimate Warrior of your dad yes they locked him in some [EXPLICIT] he was stuck there for like a day bro what hell yeah dog and then he freaked up I bet he knew these kids played so he went up he said he like went up in the tree with his 22 Long Nose rifle oh his dad's only too long on those rifle he saw him playing and he said he let off one shot and hit the kid in the neck I mean essentially that's like buried it's like the fear of buried alive yeah hell yeah so he was buried alive basically yeah one of the people that worked at this store opened it like oh [EXPLICIT] the [EXPLICIT] is this when they opened it was he like it was like there was a running track in there and there were tons of speakers there was a bunch of helpful gentlemen drift like officiators dressed like a fishy haters yeah bro damn that's [EXPLICIT] wild so he who let him out he went way too far but you don't kill you deal with it you got a lot if someone locked you in a Foot Locker for a day I I would say deal with it you can't kill somebody for that that's nuts bro dude but you remember to put your mind in the put yourself in the mind of a 12 year old spazzing true yeah that's true all right 12 year old spaz definitely in 1932 because back then it was just like and you get away Daddy's gun now yeah didn't you fight six cops for way less all right come on oh my God damn it Jesus Christ dude let me pretend to be a good guy Jesus Christ I did wait for what I beat up six cops before at the same time yes well they didn't oh yeah yeah you're a boxer they just wait like video games like this [EXPLICIT] anyway for you to hit them first yeah true I guess they come in one at a time one at a time do a little bit of kung fu yep take one out did you do any of those like you like Get Low and sweep your leg backwards on them take five of them down at once hit them all ninja turtle moves bro I'm still fascinated by that whole situation who let him out of the locker some uh I think he said it was his manager that worked at like the supermarket yeah and he said the manager was a white guy he said the guy let him out and he was like all right time to get to work and he like [EXPLICIT] this job and ran home oh my god did he have to like piss in the locker or anything he pissed and [EXPLICIT] all on himself oh yeah I mean this is you're building a case yeah dude it's so magic but imagine how when you have to like examine like first second third degree murder if you were locked in a tiny box and [EXPLICIT] on yourself yeah and then finally thank God some guy let you out I was like back to your shitty job it's like it might be gun time oh yeah I mean obviously it's not you you shouldn't shoot if that's the first thing you hear is your boss like all right you're looking back to work oh yeah might freak out yeah that might be Thomas net it's understandable you can't shoot people Bro [EXPLICIT] the kid or something you shouldn't but also as well it was 1940. yeah you get away with things in 19 1940s yeah there was you know I guess he said one of his neighbors killed another neighbor because he like stole some of his tools and the guy never got locked up yeah yeah that's a 1940s crime but not even as a 1940s just disagreement bro it happens like every day now if you do construction somebody steals your tools and you're like I'll go to Home Depot you don't kill them yeah but back then it was like you had your little tin pail it was like your great grandfather's oh yeah someone stole it your whole business class I had a way of accessing bolts and loosening them now I'm out of business [Laughter] damn that would sucked for for one thing just to tank your business yeah dude damn bro I could loosen that yeah otherwise you see that um painkiller [EXPLICIT] on Netflix no what is that you didn't see that oh Oxycontin is it like a dramaticized version of them it is nice but the fact of the matter is a bunch of people died from that [EXPLICIT] and these [EXPLICIT] is billionaires still I loved it you lived it yeah man I watched my mom go from Doctor to doctor getting new OxyContin scripts yeah dude I went through it that stuff makes me angry yeah yeah I don't really like it very much you're gonna take it this is nuts I remember I remember it was almost when when the painkiller stuff was like it would approached like a tsunami people were just like yo they're they're putting out you know they're talking about before I ever even heard of anyone getting a prescription they were already talking about how you just Chomp it and break the uh release yeah yeah what yeah I knew about people abusing Oxycontin before like it even hit the streets yeah that's crazy you think well you know I don't know any like Street Walkers who are just [EXPLICIT] panhandling and abusing drugs and then it was like one doctor gives you the prescription there's no like support in place it's like the mid 90s and I just dude I watched it tank this lady they have to use that Ground Zero with that oh absolutely yeah I watched doctors be like nah and then it was like well I'll just get a new doctor and then you go to a new doctor and they're just like yo you're in pain here you go babe like you know they hit they hit us with a fibromyalgia which is like yeah I don't know I don't know how real that is well it shows up it doesn't show up I don't think on really anything it does yeah that's the thing and then it's like you argue because it's like oh I'm I'm Ill and it's like No One Believes Me and then it's also like I read years later that like it's it's basically a syndrome that comes up after you've like really gone deep on painkillers and then when you're off them everything just hurts I thought it was when like girls are in a bad mood for too long if it's got fibromyalgia must be that time and when moms get addicted to smoking cigarettes in their room that's fibromyalgia yeah damn and then uh Comcast introduced uh Turner Classic Movies and it was just oh [EXPLICIT] yeah I think if it becomes not fair enough you get fibromyalgia one set must be nice [Laughter] she used to like throw herself on the ground in like the driveway of emergency rooms like she would throw herself in front of the ambulances so that they would put her on her bed and take her oh God damn yeah he's gonna hit you with the morph um get something while you're waiting for it yeah I don't even like being sleepy so much I don't get it where the [EXPLICIT] is the point of being sleepy all I hate being sleepy I hate just getting sleepy naturally I believe why my body doing this to me it's a woman women love sleeping they do you're right they love the net I think sleeping is painful same I hate it it's a waste of time I am you know my sleep routine is right now what my super teen is uh I stay awake for as long as I physically can and then I fall asleep going like that's it like when I fall asleep once dead yeah you're dying and then I wake up and I go [EXPLICIT] that sucks I just like I slam things around to make coffee in the kitchen yeah on three and a half hours of sleep I go never again man she's sleeping with just the most people peaceful expression on her face I'm just like what the [EXPLICIT] are you doing what's your problem how would

said when I was in like seventh grade someone told all the girls that if they laid on their stomachs gravity would pull their boobs down and make them bigger so I slept in my stomach thinking it was gonna stretch my dog and then I got comfortable like that yeah you wake up and you're like oh it kills you I think sleeping on my stomach put a slight curve in my penis you think so yeah because you pressure plate hard into the mattress and it's got nowhere to go it's like a plant growing towards the sun yeah it's got to curve out exactly yeah you don't do that I'm like a tree growing around a fence now dude Universe are the Pervert it's like the perviest [EXPLICIT] yes deviance it says it like Muslims if you Muslim you can't sleep on your left side or on your stomach really because Jen's

they're not thrown about it plus think about it and I I hate to play Devil's Advocate but I love arguing with you guys think about how crabby dudes get when they just get like frustrated and they don't know how to communicate true like you just get silently motherfuckery you know that's true and they're kind of just like okay he's mean that's true all right I guess he's mean tonight you know they love that dude women want a dudes on edge because they want to try to pull you out of it yeah yeah dude if I were to get like an emotional dances dude my wife will love nothing more than for me to come home and like slam something down and say what's the matter maybe like nothing oh [EXPLICIT] well okay then yeah she would love that oh yeah oh my God I get it what's bothering him but then on this but the other side of that coin is that you you have to be like oh and then what did you say to her you know what I mean yeah yeah it is the dance and they will tell you like just who cares if I'm upset just leave me alone you're like okay so you're not you want me to not give up so that's the last thing I should do yeah you can't do that first don't [EXPLICIT] take it you can't hit him real quick like not my problem yeah one time my girl told me she said I hate that you always try to solve my problems exactly you're telling me probably I'm about to do I don't know what like what do you do somebody's telling you problems bro you're able to try to solve them people just sit there and be like oh well I know what you're gonna do about that what do you say it's crazy that's abuse brother you shouldn't have to take that yeah I should you're right you're right I mean imagine imagine a dude imagine having a like a secondary dude brain following you around being like yo you know what you could do I'd be like I'm all ears yeah right what could I do yeah okay for sure appreciate that I wish I had that yeah it'd be awesome damn that's why I like that's why I like rolling around with my boys bruh because like if I'm with Tim and we doing some [EXPLICIT] and I think some [EXPLICIT] is done I'm like yo should I even do this right now bro you know what I'm saying the bad thing about this guys he'll be like yeah dude why not yeah [Laughter] right now dude no one likes any of my [EXPLICIT] dude no one likes any of my answers you're too supportive I hear the same thing from my wife she asked me to start raising my voice yeah what yeah because I think it's because I'm too autistic if anything gets like too contentious I'm just like this is getting complicated I'm gonna just be quiet I'm going to be quiet and think about video games yeah and then she's like you know you never even raise your voice when we argue so I have tried it and like I said dude don't listen to their answers for anything because I've I've tried it she's like what the what's your problem right even where you're like [Laughter] [Laughter] no I don't do that man it would be a nuclear test just their flesh flying over the back of their body there'd be a shadow behind her on the wall permanently yeah watch this right now because it could escalate physically and all you do is just scratch your arms her face yeah what the [EXPLICIT] so I mean magical grade bad breath [Laughter] I hate the lady with nerd rages hilarious they've never seen it I've never seen it no I think only I think only siblings only brother see that [EXPLICIT] you keep spamming crying at me it's not fair Xbox controller trying to break [EXPLICIT] that you can't break that's the high level of nerd rage that you should be able to break but you can't break it you grab a pencil you're like oh my God yeah and then cry top it off it is nice as hell though if you've got a nice pair of headphones that you're wearing that you can pick up and just slam Spike into the ground dude bounce them off a desk that's not true punch the [EXPLICIT] out of the wall well dude I've I've slowly figured out that I don't have to get completely physically floored whenever my wife's upset like today I think I like I see related radically understood it and today I took her keys out I forgot her keys were my pocket so I like walked the dogs she was trying to go somewhere oh I was on the phone with my brother and I get a text like where are you I'm like what the [EXPLICIT] do you want she's like I called you five times my stomach is like yes that'll [EXPLICIT] you bro I have your keys right now oh [EXPLICIT] over here wait a second who cares I don't give a [EXPLICIT] no problem I was it's so weird how much of that problem I was because alcohol I'm like why are you so [EXPLICIT] mean to me and she didn't even really care that much bro she was being a [EXPLICIT] but [Laughter] oh man I was part of so much of that by being like oh god oh [EXPLICIT] oh you're looking yourself up because you know what you think it's a confrontation coming and then you walk in like oh is this confrontation let me say something it's subconscious like childhood stuff it's like spaz Mom it's remnants of spasm oh so that's why I'm like that yeah if you have a spaz Mom it's like as soon as your wife gets upset you're like I think she's going it's bad so I'm like preparing myself you're ready for a humongous lady could you imagine if she doesn't listen to the cast does she Brittany yeah I told her yeah no but I'm just like because I can't imagine a worse weapon in a woman's Arsenal then you know I'm not your mother right oh yeah that wouldn't work on me because dude oh I mean I can spin that real hard doesn't matter damage is done dude you're doing it with like a seriously like a Terminator hole in your head and sparks flying out she's dingy at that point yeah true but I mean I could I could just be I could easily just be like my mom rules love my mommy I get I get I love my mommy it just doesn't feel strong to me no yeah true I shouldn't give her any ammunition but no it was nice dude we actually like navigated a situation that would have ended in like just a negative start to the day yeah and it's so funny you're adults but you do have that part of yourself that is like completely spun out over simple stuff she's like well I found the spare backup key so it's not a problem I'm like I'm glad you found that key I'm going to continue on my day I'm totally fine as well your text didn't spin me out either just both on edge dude it's amazing how much of that stuff just like you don't even realize it filters through maybe it's just me I don't know no no you're right about that but it's in my girl yeah you know my my girlfriend likes to she yells over minor things sometimes and if I'm like talking loud in any in any place anywhere anytime she shushes me bro and I hate that [EXPLICIT] dude don't do that [EXPLICIT] bro don't shush me I hate that [EXPLICIT] why you gotta talk so loud all the time because I do dude I get the same thing I hate that [EXPLICIT] why you can't whisper like I shouldn't do it like two days ago you know you're not whispering right I'm not trying to [EXPLICIT] shut up the [EXPLICIT] I hate that [EXPLICIT] dude getting shushed I hate it bro it's getting sure spins me yeah I can't stand because then you start being really loud you're like I'll be fine I'm talking at a normal volume yeah it feels like normal volume but I did realize my family we all talk loud and it made me realize that one time I was out with my ancestral thing super duper loud but I only realized when I hear my siblings talking I'm like why the [EXPLICIT] are you yelling like that and I'm like yo this is me that's the same thing I do yeah that's another thing women can do they'll get in and like do the print out of your whole family and be like you know what's [EXPLICIT] up about your family you're like what are you talking about oh my God yeah all of us are really normal and fine that can derail you for like five years yeah when they tell you how your family's [EXPLICIT] up because then you're like wait maybe she's right you should say like maybe but she is right and then you start trying to like recreate yourself but you can't you're like damn I grew up around these people yeah but then you can turn it around and be like [EXPLICIT] your family your family's [EXPLICIT] up too you want to pray yeah and give the my family my brother Tom was telling me about this recently my I have a huge family like especially on my dad's side just like literally I think it's like 70 people including all the causes novels yeah but everyone gets along for the most part my brother thinks it's actually his is a spin-off if I have a cousin who was the first one to discover our whole family was autistic because we had one cousin moved away and was like holy [EXPLICIT] my whole family extended family is like very very you know it's popular to say now but I think everyone's just touched a little bit Yeah my brother was like the reason everyone gets along so well is there's there's not like a straw I mean there is an emotional connection but it's not like expressed whatsoever not really felt either but it's just nothing but data dumps it's just our family gatherings are just dudes waiting to talk and then you see someone yeah have you been to Dorney Park yo I've never been there before everyone just dated dumps on each other okay bye it's the sickest thing in the world oh hell your

back on talking to a cashier at a store where I'm not buying anything I go hey baby how's it going I have a decent eye for women's fashion I've learned because I've been trying to embrace it when I go there and it's actually really easy to pick out clothes with them just like put that on and this on oh my God I would never thought of this I said well holy [EXPLICIT] I never thought of this either dude I'm telling you right it's actually pretty fun are you going on levels then you can access I've had to just I just started embracing I'm like I'm not gonna be a curmudgeon dude I started accessorizing I'm going this is great but like you need a little necklace dude you need a little something else so you have a full stylist yeah I'm gonna try that that might make it fun yeah because otherwise I've been trying to not not get into things if I'm gonna do a thing I'm gonna get into it rather than like when I was a teenager at the mall with like a high school girlfriend I would just be sitting there like oh say oh I'm complain like yo why does it take you so long to just pick something when I go to the mall I know exactly what I'm getting why does it take you so long to just get what the [EXPLICIT] you want what's happening right now I've been trying to get into it yeah actually it's pretty funny I was like I had a good time at one time last time we went I was just like this is so fun damn that's I use that time to go through all my group messages that I never talked anybody in and respond to all this [EXPLICIT] oh like that's what I use the time at the mall for I go through every comedian group message I'm in yeah every Christmas I got with my homies and I'm just responding say yo we said this two weeks ago I know bro but I got free time now let me answer these questions let me respond that's fair dude what do you uh what do you know as a black comedian group message y'all ain't know that really let me I just gave up secret look at the mirror yeah but really nice what are you doing right now before the record I did know about it I'm sorry I should have said that it's okay dude I went too far it's like an Open Secret I guess yeah there's a Philadelphia black comedians group message how many people were talking what you think Lemire Maybe 20 20. because I know there's been beef some beef exactly yeah probably like 20. maybe 20 30. two Ray in this group chat [EXPLICIT] no he don't [EXPLICIT] with us then it's not it's not the official it's not a fish they don't [EXPLICIT] with us like that but it's not certified sorry true yeah you do got to get two rating for it to be official no that's pretty tight what do you guys talk about uh we baby we [EXPLICIT] on we basically just [EXPLICIT] on people nice for the most part maybe lady Comics get it the worst in the in this group message really yeah lady cops get it pretty bad weird I feel like we kind of took all the Flack for that a while ago you guys are still partying there weird dude and then the black and then whatever black uh Comics that weren't invited to this group message get it pretty bad too oh okay so all y'all out there if you see in this black Philly Community you're not in it we talking [EXPLICIT] about you bro damn that sucks it's [EXPLICIT] up I'll start a group message with you guys Jason [Laughter] hey yo y'all should make a white comedians uh group message that's a hate crime that'd be a [EXPLICIT] hate crime yo they had that [EXPLICIT] uh Philly Comedy Network Facebook thing that was just oh yeah let me remember that [EXPLICIT] now you run that Lemire yeah how did you grab control of that thing uh during the pandemic uh I was bored so I was like I want to run for admin like I tried to do a presidential campaign to be who was the admin of it it was uh Nicole Yates and Alyssa trieskowski and they were being lame so I was like vote for me as admin of the Philadelphia Comedy Network what were they doing what were they doing that was uh bugging you they just weren't posting anything what was irresponsible back then to go out and do comedy you're killing people yeah they would delete certain posts too like if you put like a podcast clip Up they'd be like no this group was just for shoes you like I can't put the podcast clip in this [EXPLICIT] all right yeah good move the [EXPLICIT] over now is beautiful I had to I had to create another one because they're like they like blocked me out the group and I was like uh like if you want to do it so bad make another one I was like all right I'll make the exact same thing but wasn't it founded on like a democratic kind of vote for the admin or did you just go through like a little kill yeah I was trying to be funny democracy and he took everybody with him everybody with him damn he [EXPLICIT] them over that's pretty tight yeah I like it I like it I like to go in there and troll I like to go in there and be anonymous and be like I'm an open Miker well I'm only getting five minutes on stage how can I build an hour for my HBO special I'm only getting five minutes on stage I say I'm like maybe I should put like the new people ahead of like the old people have been doing comedy like [EXPLICIT] these old guys and then people are so amazing hey dude kill yourself who the [EXPLICIT] are they were going crazy in there bro that [EXPLICIT] was fun did you have a fake name or you went on no you can put up messages anonymously but let me know who it is like because so they knew it was me but nobody else knew it was me oh that was so much fun that is pretty funny I like people getting angry at me when it's not really me when it's really me I get depressed have you been have you been the subject of a Facebook beef um kinda kinda but I'm if I'm beefing with somebody I know I'm right because I'm quick to apologize I'm quick to say when I'm wrong so if I'm beefing with somebody it's easy for me to be like you a [EXPLICIT] and a hoe and you dead wrong you know what I'm saying yeah yeah I wouldn't beef with you under any other circumstance Trail so yeah I've had some some Facebook beasts I started the Pod a couple times I don't I don't go on Facebook anymore but I remember I uh I somehow it was pretty nice I somehow got the alt white [EXPLICIT] versus the black Comics oh [EXPLICIT] I had a thing that had like is that all white guys were being [EXPLICIT] about I think uh that warm daddy show they had like some comedian came by and they were like making fun of it I forget who it was it was like some black comedian who was on like a show it was like a funny it was just like a funny name you see they started [EXPLICIT] on it I'm like man that's [EXPLICIT] up all the white nerds are attacking the black Comics dude it was just like 500 comments stage name yes oh no it wasn't even that there was the person they booked they were like that's so stupid like who cares about this guy because it was like the guy I genuinely forget the name it was an actual like name it was like a famous person it would be I guess if you had like Urkel come before it was like something like that like a famous dude it was something like that people come with Urban Stefan I was Easter I'll go see uh what was what was his name when he was Bruce Lee I'll go see him on stage who what he work with Dr Bruce Lee no the black guy made that type of machine to be nerd cool guy karate guy nerd cool guy karate here Michael Jackson molester yeah with half a face true that's after you master karate yo you know what I didn't believe that he was he was a molester and I saw this interview and the guy was bringing up all his surgeries and he was like they said you had a dimple added to your chin they said you got your lips why they said you had dimples added to your cheeks you had your nose shaved down and the whole time he was like no no they don't give me credit for anything no I'm like oh he's just a bold-faced liar yeah bro you obviously got your nose shaved now you always got a dimple attitude the guys and he was like no oh my God no wait so your whole position is that if you lie about surgery you [EXPLICIT] kids bro but you thought that the kids were lying and you were Charmed by his response originally yes did he make comment about the allegations or I think that's why he just started having that guy put him to sleep yeah he said it was like a money grad oh that's what you're saying and some of them were money grabs which is why I believe them because some of the kids did just straight up lie Macaulay Culkin used to chill with him he he said Michael Jackson never touched them true he didn't tell the crazy guy what's the other word Corey Feldman said Michael Jackson never touched them true why did he [EXPLICIT] them bro true exactly you'd [EXPLICIT] call like okay Home Alone get past all this traps put your dick in his mouth the face you did in the mirror when he was in the bathroom and then you just slide your dick in there that is the ultimate though not for guys John Lester hidden face [EXPLICIT] Home Alone cover yeah that's a fair point now I'm glad you brought that this is the job Lester version of like uh Pua guys who are just like girls you don't have guy friends you just have guy friends who haven't [EXPLICIT] you yet it's like kids child actors listen you don't have child molest your friends there you go true damn booby trap is roller coaster so you can escape the theme park yeah Corey Feldman said no yeah McCauley said so why would he [EXPLICIT] these other kids come on yeah true maybe he's just politicking though those are those are Heavy Hitters to have on your side saying he didn't do it you know yeah he [EXPLICIT] like backup dancers for Shakira or something like that who are you gonna believe Home Alone Oh or you know this this guy with a dangly earring in his right ear that's true there's more trustworthy but here's the thing he [EXPLICIT] [EXPLICIT] the kid into being a backup dancer Felicia care he created a career for this kid bruh this was a kid when he [EXPLICIT] him he was a kid you're saying that kid would have made an accountant yes if he didn't he would have been an accountant a cashier some stupid [EXPLICIT] now here go Michael Jackson gave you the magic dick now you can dance you know what I'm saying do you think I was gonna say do you think it was like a uh you can dance or do you think in some of those sleepovers he was kind of hitting him with some cool moves okay you're right it's that that is what it is yeah he gave him the shine that's all he cared about was dead do you guys remember Emmanuel Lewis yeah yeah Michael Jackson used to hang out with him he was like Webster or something yeah he said on his lap yeah he was a he was a grown ass man at that time Webster wait what he was like Gary Coleman yeah but he's a permanent child and he was hanging out with Michael Jackson a lot and there's a video there's a video of him sitting on myself basically yeah yeah God damn dude yeah there's a video I'm sitting on Michael Jackson's lap and it looks kind of like oh it's just a kid hit on his lap but then they're like yo he was like 27 in this video totally legal it was just legally that's what you don't want to hear about it well you guys know in anime right you know how it's like uh oh [EXPLICIT] lemur you're gonna have to help me out on this but you know in in hentai it's illegal to animate child pornography yeah so the way that they get around it is they've created a ton of characters that are a thousand years old but stuck in the body of a child like [EXPLICIT] Krillin bro so he was just doing hentai with Webster yeah that's crazy so technically ah this character is over a thousand years old and damn bro I love a good loophole I tell you that way they say exactly yeah do they say exactly what how old of a body they're stuck in they just say child I mean I think you're just like scrolling through thumbnails until you find what you like I see what you're saying there you go this is all perfectly it all depends on the The Stroke of the artist yeah and that might have gone by the wayside as well that was that was the long thing are you did you follow any of that stuff they broke kids from the curse I I think Japanese high court was like the curse yeah the curse what's the what's the legality on this why are you sweating so much right now all this stuff the the anime thing where like the perverts had to stop animating like children in sexual situations like demons like succubuses yeah is that still legal yeah I think so I still I see new succubuses [Laughter] is that where the tentacle comes from they're like this isn't a child they have an octopus tentacle no that's something different that's just from their heavy Seafood diet true yeah they do eat a lot of seafood they eat a lot of octopus too exactly because they think so in America we get [EXPLICIT] by cattle to death and in Japan octopi Slither into your uterus damn and it's like you know that's good not for me but I know I yeah for sure I mean you know octopus can change the texture of their skin yeah dude they can just turn into just a little like I think they can get ribbed on you oh they can just turn like almost like a leopard that's pretty tight yes like it's not like chameleon piece of [EXPLICIT] no you're gonna change your colors bruh uh octopus can actually change the texture of their skin they can make their skin like the texture of what they're looking like that's nuts that's pretty wild damn alien [EXPLICIT] bro I got to show uh Maya lizard changing his color oh yeah he's pretty pumped on that I just told her about it it was a green lizard then it went away and I was like you know I think he turned it brown in any second right she was just like what yeah so we can hide and she was just like as soon as you saw the first person we saw a lizard turning brown she's so excited oh yeah so [EXPLICIT] pumped hell yeah show pumps yeah bro she was pumped to be equipped yeah no kids are smarter too yeah they're way smarter than us that's because people talk to them true yeah damn that's crazy you're right dude my parents were just like be quiet all the time be nice be quiet they were never like yo you see this B right here guess what this thing does right it's just like dang are you right be quiet I actually had to train myself to answer questions from the kids really because Fritz is six and he's all questions and yeah if I'm in the middle of doing something and he's like asking how it works first it's can I help and you go you can hang out with me while I do it yeah you're useless and then he'll say why are you doing that and then my instinct from my upbringing is to be like because that's how it works and instead I have to be like well you know how we plug things into the wall well there's actually electric like dude you gotta explain the whole thing step by step which is which is great and enjoyable I'm just no it is though it's fun that's not what I was wired to do I know it's so funny you start turning like you're like you tune into that just like just that's just how it works Dad how's that work go away yeah I want to get this done so your mom doesn't bother me I want to get this done before the [EXPLICIT] game starts yeah what are you writing a book get out of here I only go there when they repeat the question like if I answer you once and I got my two-year-old does this a lot where she's like Dad what's that and I'm like first of all who's that that's Sean Gardini baby chill out you know what I'm saying like don't say what's that to a person and then she'll say it again Dad what's that and I'm like I just told you who that was and I told you how to ask that question now I'm not answering you because you said it twice so that's it but I explained to her why I'm not going to answer her again yeah well apparently so I was reading this thing and they're saying that kids have like genuinely no concept of like anyone else's reality until they're seven seven years old I think like if you show a kid there's a there's a seven it was six or seven they said there's a bull so if you give a book the front screen the art or the back's orange you hold the front you go what color is the front they go green what color is this and they go orange and you flip the book back around here what color am I looking at they go green they can't yeah because they say they can't do perspective taking until they're about six or seven years old that makes sense well I would even think older because I in all honesty bro I ain't know that I felt like I was the only person that was real so I was like 19. everybody just loaded up bro I don't know why it was real I'm the only real person so for six or seven is kind of early honestly because I was like 19 20 years old what's the realization like I had I had cheated on some girl when I was in college and she was so like [EXPLICIT] up and distraught to the point where like her sister and her mom called me like yo she's really [EXPLICIT] up but you really [EXPLICIT] her up and I was like she had like a whole like family and story behind her like she's a person like she like the same way I got a story behind me she got this too I was like wait everybody got this [EXPLICIT] that's so wild damn I had the complete opposite experience where I was so aware of other people that it was almost like torture for me really really yeah oh yeah I had the exact thing Naim had I would just be like no thought yeah whatsoever I was I was stopped in my tracks regularly like with worry for other people and like that I can tell because you still kind of like that now bro you still got some of that [EXPLICIT] with you what do you mean like you're very aware of other people and like their feelings yeah you're very aware of everything I always feel like a huge piece of [EXPLICIT] I'll be like yeah [EXPLICIT] it he's like well yeah but I feel it's kind of [EXPLICIT] up I'm like yeah I guess it is essentially sad for that person to completely brush that off like you're good at presenting other people's arguments like if I'm like yo I got a problem with this guy because this is a net you're you're very good at being like how many people now you think about it like from his point of view if he's like and he's like all right you're right I'm an absolute agony over my this perspective searching dude all the time dude when I was like a pretty young kid I was probably like 10 or 11 years old and uh I I had I had brothers from um different moms or no these ones had different dads so y'all got this nice match dude none of us matched up okay yeah so I had I had a brother who almost was like that's impossible it was a part of my brain it was like got him that's not possible okay Paul is a different mom my wigger Brothers have a different Dad okay okay that's what it is yeah and so uh my brother my brother Paul was into like hardcore and [EXPLICIT] growing up and like you know he would take me to shows as a young kid and they were [EXPLICIT] pretty crazy but there was a point where my my two different wings of Brothers tried to co-mingle for a little bit and it was it was oil and water how'd they get along of course I mean they kind of tolerated each other as long as they needed the same thing from my parents right right like a ride somewhere like that but uh when they were like almost adults they went to a show and one of my wigger Brothers it was a it was a you know they're going to see like punk bands and [EXPLICIT] and my wigger brother uh tried to like grind on a dude's girlfriend oh hell yeah that's nice yo I that's so tight how much of a wigger is he like bro I did I the biggest the number one phrase that I remember him from him growing up is I remember him answering an early cell phone and being invited somewhere and he was like we'll see we'll see they gonna have honey dips there oh yeah so he had it I'm not leaving the house he had a honey dips policy basically I'm not showing up unless there's honey dibs that's an ultra wigger bro like fully scar-faced out as an adult obviously dude so tight that's so tight the honey dips I wish I had the confidence to say [EXPLICIT] like that yeah he drove a big uh Buick with like a red felt interior and just like smoked weed in the car on his lunch breaks and stuff he had a Buick yeah that's also what black people think that's a nice Buick bro that's pretty tired yeah he's [EXPLICIT] on him he had a Riviera yeah and I think a river came with 19-inch rims on it if I'm not mistaken he stayed on the uh he just reminded me yeah dude every now and again there's certain cars that white people are like whatever about that black people sweat so [EXPLICIT] hard yeah dude I used to have I couldn't remember the card he's like that's the little car dude I had a Mercury uh it was like a Mercury Sable or one of those cars Hollywood top dude had the rag top yeah and I used to when I when I was selling pills I'd always be in West Philly and these do I would come out of this bar and these dudes would have a class let me buy it off let me buy it off bro bro how much bro how much I think dude I'm not selling my car it's my only car I can't sell this to you yeah like that's your first car and then your next car is an infinity [Laughter] he tried grinding on a dude's girlfriend and he got rolled on and they [EXPLICIT] him up these were dudes that were like already spin kicking each other and they beat the [EXPLICIT] out of him and he came home and uh he had to be like wrestled down by like my dad and like two dudes because he tried to leave the house with like a kitchen knife he was gonna go back to the venue with like a eight inch kitchen knife and he had to like wrestled down and I saw him dude he was [EXPLICIT] up dude beat his ass and I was so upset for him I this dude this dude hated my guts every day of my life and we never got along and I was just I remember as a kid like losing sleep just like damn dude that probably sucked all those guys beat the [EXPLICIT] out of you yeah bro imagine we got in there with the butcher knife though oh there's a bunch of dudes like maybe one or two of them then somebody would they'd have beat his ass again and took his knife and stabbed him put him on their shoulders and another guy with a stage died and broke his neck what about a heroic musher yeah that's crazy yeah damn I marched out once in my shout out I marched out one time well Mary Stone let's get out of here do you want to tell us about your monster story now what God damn that why was that 30 minutes so fast that veterans was the fastest 30 minutes the first 30 minutes I thought it was like an app and it was Just Dance I was like that's grabbing an hour's worth yeah I think the heat made made if the first thing longer Plus in the air made the second 30 feel fast I think what type of mosh are we talking true yeah are we talking about chubby guys just like kind of no or dudes this is a crack this moves this is practice moves at JJ malins okay so this isn't even a circle pit this is just dudes babe we just bouncing off each other no dude you need to get in there and you need to start throwing hands behind you you need to get yeah I'm scared of that you need to be throwing head kicks maybe
